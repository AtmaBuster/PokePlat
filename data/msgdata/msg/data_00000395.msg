You win...\n\v011c\x0000!
\v011c\x0000  was the one\nthing I wanted to avoid...
Waaah!\n\v011c\x0000!
I want to go home with\n\v011c\x0000...
\v011c\x0000!\n\v011c\x0001!
Could it be...?\n\v011c\x0000...?
\v011c\x0000!\nHow awful!
I was confident about\n\v011c\x0000, too.
You're \v011c\x0000,\naren't you?
\v011c\x0000!\nCan't be anything else but.
I feel so helplessly angry...\nIt's \v011c\x0000!
\v011c\x0000 makes me sad...
I feel sorry for\n\v011c\x0000!
The way I feel now is\n\v011c\x0000...
I lost, but I won at\n\v011c\x0000!
I would've won if this\nwere \v011c\x0000...
My head's filled with only\n\v011c\x0000 now!
The way I lost...\nIt's like \v011c\x0000...
Isn't \v011c\x0000\n\v011c\x0001?
Aww... That's really\n\v011c\x0000...
