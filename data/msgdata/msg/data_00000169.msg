You want to challenge Candice?\rSure thing!\nI was waiting for someone tough!\rBut I should tell you, I'm tough\nbecause I know how to focus.\rPokémon, fashion, romance...\nIt's all about focus!\rI'll show you just what I mean.\nGet ready to lose!\r
Wow! You're great!\nYou've earned my respect!\rI think your focus and will bowled\nus over totally.\rOh, that's right!\nI'm supposed to give you this!\r
\v0103\x0000 received\nthe Icicle Badge from Candice.
That Icicle Badge I just gave you?\rBecause you have it, you can use the\nhidden move Rock Climb anytime, even\fwhen you're not in a battle.\rOh, and take this, too.\r
\v0108\x0000 contains the move\n\v0106\x0001.\rIf the user takes damage, the move's\npower is doubled!\rCan you imagine what sort of focus\nyou'd need to pull it off?
Do you think I should try to act\nmore like an Ice-type Gym Leader?\rLike, do you think I should be more\ncool and distant?\rThat sort of thing I have trouble\nwith.
Hey, there!\nHow's it going, Champ-to-be?\rDo you see the big snowballs placed\nhere and there?\rYou need to slide on the ice with\nenough momentum to crush them.\rThe Gym Leader is a user of\nIce-type Pokémon.\rMelt her defenses with scorching-\nhot Fire-type moves!\rIt's all about focus with this Gym.\nBear down and focus!
Oh! \v0103\x0000!\nYou've beaten the Gym Leader!\rYou were more focused than her,\nand your Pokémon picked up on it!
