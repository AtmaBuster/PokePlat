When a Pokémon faints, it just means\nit doesn't have the power to battle.\rBut it can still use hidden moves\noutside of battle!
Team Galactic took my Pokémon away.\nThey took other people's, too.\rSomething should be done, but Team\nGalactic creeps everyone out...\rWhat are they doing to my Pokémon?
I got my Pokémon back!\rI'm so happy, I feel like riding my Bike\ndown Cycling Road together with it!
BUNEARY: Bunbun!
