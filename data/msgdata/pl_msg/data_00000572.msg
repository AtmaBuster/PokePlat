A single Berry will grow into a plant\nthat makes several Berries.\rBy planting one, there will be more\nand more Berries in the world.\rI hope you will help us spread more\nBerries everywhere!\r
Please plant that Berry in soft,\nearthy soil.\rIf you come by again tomorrow,\nI'll have a different Berry for you.
Trainer, please water Berries using\nthis Sprayduck watering can.\r
Use that Sprayduck to water the soil\nwhere you've planted Berries.\rYou should also water Berry plants\nwhile they are growing.
