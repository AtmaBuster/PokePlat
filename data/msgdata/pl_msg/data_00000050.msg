I got my PIKACHU through a trade from\nsomeone somewhere in the world.\rIt grows quickly, so its level goes up\nquickly, too.\rBut it doesn't always listen to me...\rThat's because I only have one\nGym Badge.\rWe don't always have an easy time,\nbut it's still my irreplaceable partner!
PIKACHU: Pikapikapikaaah!
If everyone around the world had\nPok√©mon...\rThen everyone around the world could\ncommunicate!
