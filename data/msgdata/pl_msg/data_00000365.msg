Congratulations to you, Trainer!\rIn recognition of your outstanding\nwinning streak, our Frontier Brain is\fdemanding a match with you.\rSo, your next match is against the\nFactory Head with no right of refusal!\rAre you prepared?\r
Thorton: Bzweeeeep!\rSorry, don't mind me.\rWhat I'm using is an invention of mine.\nIt's my data-analyzing machine.\rIt's telling me what you've rented\nfor this match.\rI see! You've rented \v0100\x0000\x0000,\n\v0100\x0001\x0000, and \v0100\x0002\x0000.\rI have to say, that's a good setup.\nLike, say, \v0133\x0003\x0000 percent?\fOh, don't let that number concern you!\rAll righty, let's get going!\r
Thorton: Bzweeeeep!\rLet's see what I can see about you\nthrough my data-analyzing machine.\rSo, what have you rented for this\nmatch...?\rI see! You've rented \v0100\x0000\x0000,\n\v0100\x0001\x0000, and \v0100\x0002\x0000.\rI have to admit, that's a good setup.\rIt's a combination of friendship with\ncooperation all around.\rI'd say it's like \v0133\x0003\x0000 percent?\fOh, don't let that number concern you!\rAll righty, let's get going!\nNo losing for me this time!\r
Thorton: Hmm...\nI got handed the loss here.\rIt's not making me happy at all, losing.\nEven though I'm not happy, I did glean\fsome useful data, I suppose.\rThat makes me glad I battled you.\rSo, did you get to like those Pokémon\nyou rented?\rAs the Factory Head, it would sure make\nme happy if you did.\rNext time, come back with different\nrental Pokémon.\r
Thorton: Hmm...\nI got handed another loss.\rIt's not making me happy at all, this.\nIn fact, I'm stewing here.\rI thought I learned a lot about\nPokémon since I lost to you.\rBut that's all right.\nSome things you learn from winning.\fBut some things you learn by losing.\rI hope you'll keep renting our Pokémon\nand give me a chance to redeem myself!\r
