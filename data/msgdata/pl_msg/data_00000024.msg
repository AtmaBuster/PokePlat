Aww, man.\nI wasted money on some Poké Balls.\rI should've lowered the HP of wild\nPokémon more before throwing them.
The one thing you must remember is to\npack some Potions.\rIf all your Pokémon faint, it'll be\nlights out for you, too!
Potions are important, but sometimes,\nit's better to simply avoid battles.\rIf you want to avoid wild Pokémon for a\nwhile, just use a Repel.\rAfter all, if you don't battle, your\nPokémon can't lose HP.
