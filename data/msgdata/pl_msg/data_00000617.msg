Forget it!\nThis isn't over yet!\n
My Pokémon's getting low on HP...\nThings could be tight here.\n
What's going on here?\nWhat, I lost?!\n
Think you can take down the \nnext Pokémon like you did earlier?\n
No way! Not yet!\nNot giving up!\n
W-what? That can't be!\nMy buffed-up Pokémon!\n
You avoided the long way around?\nLet's see why you'd do that!\r
Now I understand why you decided to\nbattle with me.\n
You should go whichever way you\nwant, shortcut or the long way!\n
Only those who want to win can\nchallenge a Pokémon Gym!\r
Gggh...\nThis is humiliating!\n
One day, I'm going to become a tough\nTrainer like you.\n
You're a Pokémon Trainer, and so am I!\nOur eyes met, so battle we must!\r
Too strong!\nToo strong!
Don't be shy about talking to\nTrainers you'd like to battle.\rPokémon grow stronger and stronger\nfrom battling.
Did you get better since we met?\nI... Well, here, just look!\r
Let's have a Pokémon battle!\nHumph! But I'm gonna win!\r
You beat me?!\nYou've got talent!
It was fun battling!\nYup! I'm going to battle everyone!
Let's have another Pokémon battle!\nThis time, I'm gonna win!\r
I spy, with my little eye...\nA Trainer!\rA battle, please!\r
Oh, boo!\nI can't win!
My Pokémon are all tuckered out!\nI need to go to a Pokémon Center!
Oh, hi!\nI remember you, Trainer!\rA battle, please!\r
I get my get-up-and-go from my\nPokémon!\rHere we go!\nKRICKETOT! ZUBAT!\r
Ack! My Pokémon...
Keep out of the grass or dodge the\neyes of Trainers...?\rI always have a tough time choosing.\n
Hey, I remember your face, Trainer.\nYou'll battle me again, won't you?\r
I'm never apart from my SHINX.\nOur bond is strong!\r
So sad...\nAnd so crushed...\n
I don't bear grudges over losing.\nBut I promise I'll get tougher!\n
I'm always with my Pokémon.\rActually, you're always with your\nPokémon too, aren't you?\r
Before I challenge the Pokémon Gym\nLeader, I'll test my strength on you!\r
I guess it means I'm not ready for\nthe Gym challenge yet...\n
I guess if you don't have a single\nGym Badge, you're a total nobody...\n
I'm about ready to challenge the\nPokémon Gym Leader.\rBut before I do, let me test my\nstrength on you again!\r
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from\nthe Gym Leader in Oreburgh City!\r
Oh, I lost! Lalala!\n
I'm collecting lots of Gym Badges.\nThey're so sparkly and pretty!\n
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from\nthe Gym Leader in Oreburgh City!\r...Did I show you already?\r
I found a Trainer while looking for\nsome Pokémon!\r
Hunh? You're finished so soon?\n
I walk through tall grass until I\nfind the Pokémon I want.\n
I found a familiar-looking Trainer!\r
Oh, a weak-looking Trainer...\nDo you want to have a go?\r
Aww...\nI should have said no.\n
Oh, you're so mean!\nI just started training Pokémon!\n
Hi, pretty-tough Trainer!\nWill you give me a rematch?\r
I'll beat you with the MAGIKARP my dad\ngave me!\r
But they're Pokémon I got from my\ndad...\n
Who gave you your first Pokémon?\rYour first Pokémon is the one with\nthe most fond memories, I think.\n
This time, I'll beat you with the\nPokémon my dad gave me!\r
May I please trouble you for a\nbattle?\r
Oh...\nYou're so strong...\n
Maybe I could have won if my Pokémon\nwas holding a Berry...\n
Excuse me, may I please trouble you to\nhave one more battle?\r
Hey, hey, let me show off my bug\nPokémon!\r
I'm not going to be able to explain\nthe charms of bug Pokémon this way!\n
Bug Pokémon grow quickly, and they do\nstuff like poison and paralyze, and\fthey're cute and yet cool.\rYou gotta believe me. They're good!\n
So, listen. Tell me you've grown to\nlike bug Pokémon since we last met?\r
What kind of person are you, to be\ndrawn here by the scent of flowers?\r
It was a strong Trainer who was drawn\nhere by the scent of flowers!\n
By the way, have you collected new\napps from the Pokétch Company?\n
You came back to me because you\ncouldn't forget the smell of flowers!\r
Liv: We can one-shot this Trainer,\ncan't we, Liz?\r
Liv: Oh, oh, oh?\n
Liv: This Trainer...will brag about\nbeating us, Liz.\n
Liv: You only have one Pokémon?\nThat's so boring!
Liv: Oh! You're that Trainer!\nLet's get payback, Liz!\r
Liz: We're the strongest in our\nclass!\r
Liz: Oh, but, wait!\n
Liz: This Trainer...is really happy about\nbeating us, Liv.\n
Liz: Um, will you battle with us?\nMe and Liv?\n
Liz: We're the best in our class.\nWe can't be losers all the time!\r
Hey, how about you and me battle before\nI go into Eterna Forest?\r
That really dampened my spirits.\n
I heard that really tough Pokémon\nappear in Eterna Forest.\rI need to be more prepared than this!\n
You've been to Eterna Forest\nalready, right? How was it?\r
It's a long way between Floaroma\nand Eterna City. So, let's battle!\r
Wawawaah!\nI'm out of Pokémon that can go!\n
Camping with Pokémon!\nDo you have any idea how fun that is?\n
While I was enjoying camping, my\nPokémon got all buffed up!\r
What kinds of Pokémon live around\nhere, I wonder?\r
I'm shocked!\nHow did I lose?\n
I know all sorts of things about\nPokémon!\rLet's see... There are males and\nfemales, and some aren't either!\n
Oh, hi! We meet again!\nHave you seen any rare Pokémon?\r
Oh, I don't know.\nShould I play a little?\r
Oh, boo!\nHow insulting!\n
Listen very closely...\nCan you hear the cries of Pokémon?\n
Oh, I don't know.\nShould I play a little again?\r
There's no mountain here, but I'm\ndressed to hike! Gahaha! Here goes!\r
Oh, yeah!\nA refreshing battle that was!\n
You can find the same kinds of\nPokémon in all sorts of places.\rThere's no law saying a Hiker can't\ngo searching off in the mountains!\n
If you meet someone in the mountains,\nthey're no longer strangers.\rMeet them twice, and they're your\nfriend!\r
I've lost my way...\nHere of all places...\r
Having lost his way, the Trainer lost\nthe battle too...\n
From being lost in the mountains so\nlong, I became a Hiker...\n
I've lost my way again...\rYes, it's me again with no sense of\ndirection...\r
Hiyah!\nThere's no holding anything back!\r
I... I concede!\nI think you're on a different level...\n
Hiyah! You put me in my place!\nI appreciate it!\n
Hiyah! This time, there really is no\nholding anything back!\r
I love Pokémon that smell sweet.\nLike this one--get a whiff of this!\r
Did you understand what I meant?\nDidn't my Pokémon smell nice?\n
If you plant lots of Berries, you\ncan be surrounded by sweet scents.\n
Sniff... Oh?\nYour Pokémon smells nice!\r
Nothing's biting...\nI could use a break, I suppose.\r
Well, that didn't do anything for me...\n
!\rYank your fishing rod when that\nappears. That's how you fish.\n
All right! I caught some tough\nPokémon. I'm ready for battle!\r
How about that!\nI've netted me a feisty Trainer!\r
I let a big win slip away...\n
Do you have a fishing rod?\nCatch some big ones!\n
Hey, you feisty tyke! I caught a big\none! Let's battle again!\r
I fished up some tough Pokémon!\nLet's have ourselves a battle!\r
Losing to a kid has me gasping like\na MAGIKARP...\n
My feet are tangled, too!\nOuch! Ouch!\n
I'm going to win this time!\nI said I'll win, and I mean it!\r
Yo! Cycling and Pokémon!\nWhich do you prefer?\r
Hey, not bad, you!\n
This Cycling Road is one fine place--\ngreat bikes, superb Pokémon,\fand awesome Trainers all around!\n
I'm sure I've seen your face before.\nDid we maybe battle?\r
Ding-ding! Watch out, you!\nOr, did you want to battle?\r
Despite all the effort, I'm just spinning\nmy wheels...\rIt's always that way with me!\n
I might try racing through Cycling\nRoad in one long shot.\n
There you are!\rI've been riding in this spot so I'd\nget a rematch with you!\r
That Bike you've got there...it's the\ntype that can change gears!\rYou gotta love that!\nSure, I'll give you a battle!\r
Crash! Tinkle...\n
The 3-speed makes for easy turning,\nand the 4-speed's for going fast.\rI love them both!\n
Is your bicycle geared to 3-speed now?\nOr do you have it set to 4-speed?\r
A bike will carry you a long way.\rThe only thing that limits you is your\nown endurance!\r
Gasp... Gasp... Gasp...\n
My Pokémon and I are plumb worn out.\nWe should be getting home to rest...\n
We took a recuperative rest.\nWe're not losing this time!\r
Cycling feels great!\rIt will feel even better when I beat\nyou in a battle!\r
Whew!\nYou worked us over.\n
I like spinning the pedals backward\nwhile sailing downhill.\n
It feels great on my Bike!\rI'm already sweaty, so let's have a\nrematch!\r
The both of us are on Bikes, and we\nboth have Pokémon!\rI can't let you get the better of me!\r
Oh, geez...\nI seem to have fallen off my Bike.
I should have challenged you to a race,\nnot a battle!\n
I hate knowing you've beaten me.\nThis time, I'm going to win!\r
If you beat me, you can count on\nsomething rotten coming your way!\r
Kerrrash!
Aww!\nWhy did you beat me?!\rI hope you get so lost in Wayward Cave\nyou cry! Boo-hoo-hoo!\n
I had to get my revenge on you.\rI trained my Pokémon while wandering\flost in Wayward Cave!\r
Some people compete over speed, and\nsome compete over technique.\rWhich kind are you?\r
You're a speedy technician!\n
I enjoy the scenery.\rDon't you think the area below\nCycling Road looks nice?\n
I polished up both my speed and\ntechniques. Can you beat me now?\r
Whoa! You startled me!\nWell, we may as well battle!\r
Your power startles me!\n
We Hikers are bighearted guys!\nLosing doesn't bother us!\n
Whoa! You startled me!\nWe may as well have a rematch!\r
I wear shorts the whole year!\nI've got energy to burn!\r
I couldn't win with just energy...\nNothing's really that easy!\n
Pokémon don't wear clothes.\nI worry about them getting cold.\n
I wear shorts! I have lots of\nenergy! I'm not losing to you!\r
Go for it, my Pokémon!\nI'll do my best, too!\r
Oh...\nWe lost...\n
Dig for Fossils in the Underground.\rThe mining museum might be able to\nbring back the ancient Pokémon!\n
Go for it, my Pokémon!\nI'll do more than my best this time!\r
Go do it, my Pokémon!\nI'll work hard, too!\r
Oh...\nWe lost...
I think we'll visit the TV station in\nJubilife City next.\rOr maybe we should go to the Global\nTerminal?\n
Umm, aren't you that Trainer who beat\nus before?\rWe feel good today, so we'll be happy\nto face you again!\r
Wahaha!\nLaughter brings good fortune!\r
Wahahaha! There's nothing that\nI can do but laugh!\n
Wahahahaha!\n...Go ahead, laugh at me--the loser!\n
Wahaha!\rLaughter brings good fortune!\nForgetting your gloves brings a cold!\r
I just got through Mt. Coronet, but\nI've still got energy to burn!\r
Whoops!\nTaken down easily!\n
We need to rest up in Oreburgh City\nbefore heading to Mt. Coronet again.\n
I just got through Mt. Coronet,\nand who do I see?\rA Trainer who we've battled before!\r
OK, OK!\nLet's be quick about this!\r
Oh, yeah? Let's do this again!\n...Oops. I'm out of Pokémon!\n
Yup! Good going!\nI like the way you battle!\n
What took you so long?\rWe've waited here a long time for\na rematch with you!\r
Gahahaha! You're just a little kid!\rHow're you supposed to beat a big\nman like me?\r
Oh my, a big man like me got schooled\nby a little kid like you!\n
Wow, you're sure impressive!\rI guess it makes no difference if\nyou're young or old in battles.\n
Hey, you, tough little kid!\nThrow us a rematch, will you?\r
They call me the Echo Man!\nBattle with me! Yahoo!\r
Ohh... Yo...\nYodelay...\n
Here's good advice from the Echo Man!\rIf you're at a loss as to where you\nshould be going, check the Town Map!\n
Oh, hi there! Remember us?\nI'm the Echo Man!\rLet's have another battle!\nYahoo!\r
If I beat you, will you share some\nfood with me?\r
We were starved for food, and now\nwe're starved for a win...\n
Sigh... I feel even hungrier...\nMaybe I'll chow down some Berries...\rBut that's kind of gross.\nWhat am I, a Pokémon?\n
I, uh, chowed down my packed lunch\nbefore we started climbing.\rIf I beat you this time, share some\nfood with me!\r
This karate man's going to pulverize\nyou!\r
We got pulverized...\n
It's obvious I need to train myself\nand my Pokémon harder.\rHey, if you've got a Vs. Seeker, you'd\nbetter put it to good use.\rNothing beats some repeated battling\nfor toughening up your Pokémon.\n
This karate man hasn't forgotten\nbeing pulverized by you!\r
Muhihi...\nI'll haul you up and out!\r
Restraint is my favorite word.\nLike...from crushing my opponents.\n
You need a Good Rod if you want to\ncatch good Pokémon.\n
Muhihi... There won't be any\nrestraint this time, OK?\r
Oh, you want to have a battle?\rI was meaning to enter a Contest,\nbut beating you won't take long...\r
Oh, you have us beaten.\n
You and your Pokémon have so much\nenergy.\rI think you would do well in\nContests, too.\n
Oh, didn't we meet before?\rI was meaning to enter a Contest,\nbut let's have a quick battle first.\r
You and I!\rLet us create a scene!\nA fantastic tableau of battle!\r
Magnificent!\nI am aglow with inspiration!\n
That battle will surely become a\nstupendous masterpiece painting!\rI shall title it...\r“My Pokémon Is Fight”!\n
The key to becoming a good painter\nis to be observant.\rThat is the same for battling.\nOne must be observant!\r
Let me see how much you've raised\nyour Pokémon.\r
Good stuff! Your Pokémon are in\nimpeccable condition.\n
It's obvious you raise your Pokémon\nwith a lot of love.\n
I've raised my Pokémon since we met.\nHow much have you raised yours?\r
Please, let me battle the Pokémon\nyou've raised!\r
Giggle...\nThey're raised with a lot of care!\n
Raise your Pokémon with lots of love,\nand they'll bond closely with you.\n
You're that Trainer who treats Pokémon\nwith a lot of love!\rPlease, let me battle the Pokémon\nyou've raised again!\r
Say, honey, where'd you come from?\nWhat kinds of Pokémon are you with?\r
Fancy folks like you have fancy\nPokémon too, it looks like.\n
While working the ranch, I get to raise\nmy Pokémon, too.\rI'd say it's the best of both worlds!\n
Oh, howdy! Come visiting again?\nWhat kinds of Pokémon'd you bring?\r
I jog every morning to keep my\nPokémon fit.\r
Oops!\nYou threw off my running rhythm.\n
Nothing beats being fit and healthy!\rCome on, won't you run with me?\nTo a better tomorrow!\n
Do you jog every morning, too?\n
When I go on my jogs, I pass by lots\nof people.\rI have trouble remembering faces,\nbut we did meet before, right?\r
                      
                            
                           
                   
                         
                                      
               
              
                        
Hi, hi!\nI'm a Pokémon!\r
So sad...\nSo bitter...\n
I don't want to be a Trainer.\nI want to be a Pokémon!\n
Hi, hi!\nI'm a Pokémon!\r...You knew that, didn't you?\r
                       
           
                        
Ty: You're not supposed to intrude\non my time with Sue!\r
Ty: I only have eyes for Sue.\nMaybe that's why we lost?\n
Ty: Sue, even in defeat, you're\nso beautiful...!\n
Ty: I don't want to do anything\nwithout Sue...\rBring two Pokémon at least, OK?\n
Ty: Did you come back to intrude\non my time with Sue?\r
Sue: Huh?\nYou want to battle with me?\rI will if I can team with Ty!\r
Sue: I'm sorry, Ty!\n
Sue: We lost... Ty, I need a hug\nto make it all better!\n
Sue: I only want to battle next to my\nsweet Ty.\rDon't you have two Pokémon?\n
Sue: Oh, it's you again!\nI'll battle if I can team with Ty!\r
                      
                   
                                 
                                               
                                
                       
                                               
                                                      
Jogging is about rhythm.\nBattling is about rhythm, too!\r
It's a goal of sorts, I'd say!\n
If I get out of rhythm, I can't get my\nact together.\n
When I was jogging the other day,\na wild Pokémon came after me.\rI ran so fast, I was on top of the\nwaves, I swear!
Jogging is about rhythm.\nBattling is about rhythm, too.\fOur rematch is also about rhythm!\r
Emma: We're tough because we battle\ntogether!\r
Emma: Waaah!\n
Emma: That was awesome!\nAre you maybe a Pokémon genius?\fYou're well deserving of respect!\n
We won't talk to people who have only\none Pokémon!\n
Emma: When I battle with Lil,\nwe shouldn't lose!\r
Lil: We're gonna crunch and\nmunch you all up!\r
Lil: Hwaaah!\n
Lil: We're going to be super-strong\nTrainers like you!\rI just decided now!\nPlease cheer for us!\n
We don't talk to people who have only\none Pokémon!\n
Lil: You munched us all up last\ntime, but it's our turn now!\r
Hey, check this out! Look at the\nluster of my Pokémon's fur!\r
Hey, hey, did you take a good look?\n
The Veilstone Department Store is\npretty impressive!\rDid you know they even sell Poffins?\n
I brushed my party a lot.\nSo we'd be ready for a rematch!\r
I'm a rookie breeder, but I'll do\nmy very best!\r
It's all right!\nI'm still a rookie!\n
The best way to raise Pokémon?\r...Hmm, when it comes right down to it,\nisn't it all about love?\n
I can't be a rookie forever.\nI've learned a lot since we last met.\r
                             
           
                                                       
                      
                
                         
                                               
                           
                                
                               
                              
                          
                            
                           
          
                               
                           
        
                                
                                
                
                              
Teri: Yay! We're gonna battle with\nlots of Pokémon!\r
Teri: We tried really hard together,\nbut we lost anyway.\n
Teri: Our mommy is a twin, too.\n
Teri: We want to battle with lots\nof Pokémon.\n
Teri: Yay! We're gonna battle with\nlots of Pokémon again!\r
Tia: Yay!\nWe're all going to battle!\r
Tia: We tried really hard together,\nbut we couldn't win anyway.\n
Tia: When Mommy and Aunty and me\nand Teri get together, it's really\fconfusing and fun!\n
Tia: Um, no.\nWe all want to battle together.\n
Tia: Yay!\nWe're all going to battle again!\r
My Pokémon toughened up while working\non the ranch.\rI'm right proud of them!\r
Hahahah! Your Pokémon sure can be\ncounted on!\n
When I cuddle with my Pokémon, I can\nfeel not just their bodies' warmth, but\ftheir compassion.\n
Whoa! You're that real-tough\nTrainer from before!\rHere are my ranch-toughened Pokémon!\nI'm right proud of them!\r
I'm warmed up and limber.\nI'm OK to battle!\r
...Oh, serious woe.\nI wasn't prepared emotionally for this.\n
I wish I could just run from all this...\nJust joking.\n
I'm going to keep running.\nJust as long as there's a road...\n
I've been training so I can have\na rematch with you.\rI'm OK to battle!\r
Matt: Uhohoho! I'll show y'all how\ntightly I've bonded with my daughter!\r
Matt: Parent-and-child power couldn't\nget the job done.\n
Matt: I reckon the bonds between you\nand your Pokémon are like the bonds\fparents share with their kids.\n
Matt: Oh, there's no way you could\nbeat us both with one Pokémon.\n
Matt: Ayuh? You're here to check the\nbond I have with my daughter again?\r
Ava: I can get away with slacking\noff if I have my Pokémon out!\r
Ava: Oh, sheesh!\n
Ava: Papa, I'm so sorry!\nI'll work harder from tomorrow on!\r...Yup, tomorrow's when I'm going to\nstart working.\n
Ava: You're battling me and my pa.\nOne Pokémon won't cut it, dear!\n
Ava: Oh, hi! It's good y'all came\ncalling on us again!\rI can take a break from work if I'm\nbattling Pokémon. Lucky for me!\r
I am one of the Ninja Trio!\nBeing discovered means I must battle!\r
I concede defeat...\n
My cover is blown, so what should\nI do?\rMaybe I'll go catch some Contests in\nHearthome City. Maybe I'll do that.\n
Do you remember me?\nI am one of the Ninja Trio!\fBeing discovered means I must battle!\r
I am one of the Ninja Trio!\nBeing discovered means I must battle!\r
I concede defeat...\n
While I hid in the tall grass, I\nsensed Pokémon all around me!\rFurtive sounds of movement...\nStifled cries... I heard them!\n
You don't remember me?\nI am one of the Ninja Trio!\fBeing discovered means I must battle!\r
I am one of the Ninja Trio!\nBeing discovered means I must battle!\rBut how did you discover me?\nDon't tell me you're a ninja, too!\r
I concede defeat...\n
A Pokémon Trainer's good at finding\nstuff, I guess.\n
You should join us so we can form\nthe Ninja Quartet!\rAnyway, let's battle!\r
You seem to have a lot of confidence.\nLet's see if it's justified!\r
Haha!\nA total loss for me!\n
You seem to have an abundance of\ntalent. It's pretty amazing.\n
When I lost to you last time, I was\njust unlucky.\r
As an Ace Trainer, I have to take\nbattles in stride.\rI need to stay cool and calm whether\nI win or lose.\r
Aiyeeeeh!\nWe lost!\n
How dare you beat us!\nGo away! Go!\n
Last time, I got a little emotional\nover losing...\rI'll stay cool and calm today!\r
Very well. I've decided.\rI'll battle one last time, with you,\nthen I'm retiring as a Trainer.\r
I've lost, but...\nWhat is this rush I feel?!\n
Yes! This is fun!\nPokémon are fun!\fRetire? Perish that thought!\rI'll become a lot tougher.\nNext time, victory is mine!\n
Your young power against my veteran\ntechnique...\rLet us battle again to see who wins\nthis time!\r
This buff physique isn't just for\nshow!\r
B-but!\nMy buff physique!
Why? Is it because my training isn't\nenough?!\n
My buff physique!\nFeast your eyes on it again!\r
I just startled you!\rWhile you're still struggling to\nrecover, I'll already be the winner!\r
Oh, what's that?\nYou're supposed to be fumbling more.\n
I wanted a better reaction from you.\nNow I feel silly for hiding!\n
You just saw me, and I bet you\nthought, “Long time no see.”\rWhile you're still thinking that, I'll\nalready be the winner!\r
We ninjas appear where you least\nexpect us!\r
I didn't expect to lose...\n
While hiding, I think about what Pokémon\nmust be thinking inside their Poké Balls.\n
Wah! Another chance encounter with\na foe who defeated me before!\r
A ninja can use all kinds of skills.\nLike this and like that!\r
Hmm...\nMy ninja techniques failed to work...\n
There's a ninja Gym Leader somewhere\nfar away.\rI should become a devotee of theirs.\n
What's with you?\nYou're not a ninja yet?\r
Try not to be shocked when you lay your\neyes on my Pokémon!\r
Oh, my...\nGood golly 'n' gosh...\n
A dragon Pokémon's real power is\nnothing like mine!\n
You again?\rYou must really like that dragon\nPokémon I use.\r
I'll teach you about the charms of\nbird Pokémon!\r
Well, that was surprising!\n
The sight of you battling...\nIt was simply a wonder to watch!\n
Are you finally noticing the great\nqualities of bird Pokémon?\r
Zac: Jen, watch this! I'm going to\nuse everything you've taught me!\r
Zac: Wow. Someone that's even\nbetter than Jen...\n
Zac: I don't care if I get to meet\nthe greatest Trainer in the region...\fI'd still rather learn from Jen.\n
Zac: Would you be interested in battling\nthe two of us at the same time?\rWhat I mean is, do you have two or more\nPokémon with you?\n
Zac: This time, I'm not gonna let you\ndown, Jen! I promise!\r
Jen: Here comes a Trainer.\nZac, you ready? Let's do this!\r
Jen: I just got embarrassed in front\nof my little buddy here...\n
Jen: Zac, I'm so sorry.\nI'm a failure as your instructor.\n
Jen: Would you like to have a\ntwo-on-two Pokémon battle with us?\n
Jen: Here comes our Trainer!\nAre you ready this time?\r
Look at these beautiful wings!\r
Oh, you!\nI'm going to peck you for that!\n
There's a bird Pokémon that can learn\nhuman speech! Did you know that?\n
My bird Pokémon has such gorgeous\nwings.\rIt must have been some sort of a\nmistake that we lost last time!\r
                 
                  
              
ZUBAT! Doesn't that sound like a\nninja bursting from cover?\r
Oh!\nMy ZUBAT tristars...\n
Sowing confusion among the foe is\none way a ninja battles.\rA Pokémon can't overcome its\nconfusion unless it switches out.\n
The shinobi live by speed!\nI'll get in my attacks before you do!\r
See how Mt. Coronet towers above us.\nI want to be big like that one day!\r
You loom before me as a giant presence!\n
Mt. Coronet has long been known as\nan ancient and mysterious mountain.\n
Hmm?! \nYou loom before me again?!\rYou're like Mt. Coronet that way!\r
Hah! Hah!\nI'm psyched for this! Here goes!\r
I don't get why we can't win.\n
I don't reminisce over yesterday.\nI don't think about tomorrow.\fI only live today to the fullest.\fThat's my policy!\n
Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah!\nThis time, I'm properly psyched!\r
Speed is a ninja's best weapon!\nCan you keep up?\r
I did a lot to conceal myself, too...\n
I'll wait here for a weaker-looking\nTrainer and then ambush them!\n
I became even faster!\nHow can you hope to keep up?\r
I go everywhere with my NOCTOWL.\nWe're gonna show you owl best! Ha!\r
We did our best. That's what\nmatters. Right?\n
Even on cold days, just being with\nmy NOCTOWL keeps me warm!\n
I curled up inside my NOCTOWL's wings\nand waited for you to return!\r
Whilst exploring the ruins, I spotted\na Trainer! I must investigate!\r
My investigation has revealed the\nTrainer to be tough! Ouch...\n
Celestic Town is an old town.\nI'm sure to find something cool.\n
Whilst exploring the ruins, I spotted\nyou again! I will now investigate!\r
My Pokémon sleeps in a bed I got from\noverseas.\rI'm very well off, if you haven't\nnoticed!\r
What? Over already?\nWell, that's fine.\fRich people like me don't fight.\n
Oh, no.\nMy Pokémon is worn out.\rI'd better let it sleep it off in the\nbed I had sent from overseas.\n
I do this only because I love my\nPokémon. Winning isn't that important.\r
I'd like to begin now.\nAre you quite prepared?\r
Oh!\nHow terrible of you...\n
You... You must have one fantastic\nteacher to be so good.\n
We meet again.\nAre you quite prepared?\r
If it pleases you, may I challenge you\nto a battle?\r
Bravo! Your technique is impeccable\nfor someone so young.\n
Hahaha! I was invited by the master of\nthe Pokémon Mansion.\rHe's promised to show me through\nhis prized garden of Pokémon.\n
If it pleases you, would you care for\na rematch with me?\r
I've never battled a young Trainer like\nyourself. It's quite nerve wracking.\r
Oh, dear... That wasn't anything like\nbattling with my friends.\n
Usually, I'll have matches with\nmembers of my social club.\n
Oh, it's you again, dear?\rIt makes me a little nervous to ask,\nbut may I have a rematch?\r
                          
                 
                                                      
Hold it right there, citizen!\nWalking around at night is unsafe!\r
You've got tough partners with you.\nCarry on, citizen. Carry on.\n
Out so late? Does your mother\nknow you're out so late?\n
Well, hello there!\rThat's very civil minded of you to\nsay hello to your local Policeman!\n
Didn't I already give you a warning?\nIt's unsafe to walk around at night!\r
I'm keeping my eyes open for crime.\nAnyone arousing suspicion here?\r
Now, just hold on. I didn't say that\nyou were shady looking!\n
Don't go hanging out with any\nshady-looking characters! You hear?\n
Patrolling night and day sure is\nexhausting... Yawn...\n
Any shady-looking characters around?\nI'm always on the lookout for punks.\rExpecting some shady dude to actually\npop up... Does that make me weird?\r
Let's enjoy a fierce battle in the\nchilly night winds! Brrrr! Refreshing!\r
I need to explain, all right?\nIt was too dark and hard to see.\n
Oops, I'd better get back to my\nbeat before the boss radios me...\n
Yo! Hanging tough, Trainer? Word!\nI'm trying to make my lingo more hip!\n
Still training this late?\rThat makes you either a bad kid or\na good Trainer. Which one is it?\r
Whether there are problems or not, or\nif crimes have been committed or not,\fI still go out on patrol.\r
Big trouble! Officer in need\nof assistance!\n
Your toughness is too much!\nI'm in serious trouble!\n
I don't know how to say this, but\nmaybe we patrol too much.\n
Let me ask you a question!\nAre you tough enough to take me?\r
Can't you see I'm fishing?\nDon't talk! You'll spook the fish!\r
How do you like that?\nBoth my catch and the win got away!\n
Fishing and battling are delicate\nthings--as am I. Is that wrong?\n
You can see I'm fishing, can't you?\nThen don't talk to me! Geez!\r
I wish some fishing-loving lady'd come\nalong. But no, it's all just Trainers.\r
Sure, so I lost.\nBut I'll keep on fishing.\n
If you know of any ladies that like\nfishing, help me reel 'em in!\n
Umm... Yeah. Weren't you that person\nwho preferred Pokémon over fishing?\r
Water Pokémon sure get happy when\nit rains. So do I!\r
Oof. Just got trampled right under\nyour feet that time!\n
Yup, a kid like you should be running\naround outside, rain or shine.\n
I've been fishing here ever since\nI lost to you.\r
Hi, Trainer!\nCan you keep up with me?\r
You've got energy to burn!\n
Even if a battle gets heated, don't\nbreak branches off trees or anything.\n
You're that energetic Trainer!\nI bet you can't keep up this time!\r
Heya, Trainer!\nAre you being good to Mother Nature?\r
Good. You seem to be a kindhearted\nTrainer.\n
Listen, people and Pokémon, we're all a\npart of Mother Nature.\n
Heya, long time!\rAre you enjoying your nature-filled\nadventure with Pokémon?\r
Protect the natural environment.\nThat's what we Rangers do!\r
We've got to get tougher than this...
I love how natural it is here.\nI wish I could live out here.\n
What do you think? The environment\nis unharmed in this area.\r
                   
                             
                                          
                               
                             
       
                                                           
                                          
I find it reassuring to be on this\ndamp soil...\r
Ufufufufu...\nYou had to beat me...\n
It feels good to mope here after a\nloss... Ufufufufu...\n
Is Damp my favorite Pokémon ability?\nFufufu... Anything will do...\r
                             
                
                                   
                            
       
                                 
                  
                           
                             
                           
I'm proud of my Pokémon!\nHere, I'll show you why!\r
Youch! You sure showed me how tough\nyou were.\n
Oh, what have we here?\nThat's a Pokédex!\rIt records Pokémon data upon\nsight? I've never seen one before!\rI heard you can move the sun or\nmoon icon to check the Pokémon\fhabitat map by time of day!\n
I take down details in my notebook\nabout Pokémon I've battled.\rI'll write more data down about your\nPokémon!\r
Oh? Here comes a nice-looking\nTrainer. This is worth evaluation.\r
Our research has arrived at this one\nconclusion: you're a tough one!\n
A huge variety of Pokémon live in the\nGreat Marsh.\rYou see, countless years ago,\nthis whole area was under the sea.\n
Oh, how do you do? May I investigate\nhow much tougher you've become since\four last encounter?\r
There are Pokémon that grow stronger\nwhen it's raining.\r
Like rain, my tears flow from losing...\nThey call me the Rain Woman...\n
I want to show off my pretty parasol,\nbut it will get dirty in the rain.\rOh, such a big dilemma!\n
On rainy days, I get more energetic!\r
When it rains, I get more tense!\r
It's not very easy trying to battle\nwhile holding an umbrella.\n
If it rained every day, I could have\nmy umbrella open all the time.\n
It's not because it's raining.\nI just love umbrellas!\r
Your whole atmosphere is shady.\nCooperate in this investigation!\r
Defeated by sneakiness...\n
I mistook your toughness as shadiness!\nIt's an honest mistake!\n
We're constantly on patrol.\nThat way, it's safe even at night.\n
Whoa! Hold it right there!\nI've spotted a sneaky Trainer!\r
I swim the whole year round.\nI'm not losing a battle at sea!\r
I lost at sea! But I swim here the\nwhole year round!\n
When you're out at sea, Water-type\nPokémon look more lively.\n
I love the sea. It was only by fluke\nthat I lost last time.\r
Brr... I'm starting to get chilly.\nI could use a win to get warmed up.\r
The chill of the sea, and the\ncoldness of defeat...\rIt's a double whammy.\n
Look at my lips...\nThey're the color of prunes!\n
Brr... I'm starting to feel chilly.\nHow about a hot Pokémon battle?\r
Hi, wave-riding Trainer!\nHow about a battle on the sea?\r
You sure schooled me there.\n
Maybe I should switch to surfing,\ntoo...\n
Hi, we meet again!\nWave-riding Trainer!\r
Hello, there!\nAren't you going to swim?\r
What's saltier?\nMy tears or the sea...\n
There aren't many sea routes that\nyou can swim in Sinnoh.\rIt makes me want to take a vacation\nin the Hoenn region.\n
When I see people surfing, I don't\nfeel jealous or anything.\rI just simply love to swim!\r
Isn't this nice?\nI love my inflatable tube!\r
It's not easy trying to move holding\non to this inflatable tube.\n
Mom blew up my inflatable tube for me.\nI ran out of breath just opening it!\n
You can come back all you like, but\nyou can't have my inflatable tube!\r
Ehehe...\nI can battle, too!\r
Losing made me all hungry now.\n
That cloud looks like giant ice cream!\nI bet it tastes yummy!\n
I've been dawdling here all this\ntime!\r
                
         
                               
Traveling alone, are you? That's\nimpressive! How about we battle?\r
You're good, pip-squeak!\n
Maybe I'll go work out down at the\nrestaurant again.\rThat place gets different people in\nevery day, and they all like battles.\n
Hey, lonesome traveler! Let's break\nthe monotony with another battle!\r
Waah! Now! Just now!\nI was just about to reel it in!\r
You need to have more respect for\na grown-up...\n
Go on. Don't be shy about going up to\npeople to hear what they have to say...\rJust don't you talk to me.\n
Waah! Now! Just now!\nI was just about to reel it in!\r...Right. You again!\r
                             
                       
                                    
                       
                             
                              
                          
                                  
Let me demonstrate my technique.\nIt's how this grown-up battles.\r
Oh, my gosh!\nYou attack that savagely?\n
You're so much more of a Trainer\nthan you look!\n
OK, this time I'll really show you how a\ngrown-up battles!\r
Ah-ha! I found me a Trainer!\rI challenge you to battle with\nthe Pokémon I've found!\r
It's a challenge trying to win with\nPokémon one isn't familiar with...\n
Discovery is the treasure I seek.\nCollecting a lot is my life!\n
Ah-ha! I found me a Trainer!\rI challenge you to battle with\nthe Pokémon I've found!\r
I travel all over the world in search of\nmysteries.\r
Gasp... One more... Gasp...\nIt's like I went on a diet...\n
There are mysteries waiting for me\nto investigate around the world.\rThis is no time to be feeling sorry\nfor myself.\n
There's an endless supply of\nmysteries around the world.\rRunning into you here just happens\nto be one such mystery!\r
                                                       
                
                           
                 
                
                            
                          
                
                        
                     
                        
                               
I'd sensed the presence of a\nTrainer for a while. It was you!\r
Defeating you will be no easy matter.\n
Is it possible to become more\npowerful by understanding Pokémon?\n
I was certain that you'd return.\nI sensed your presence, you see.\r
There!\nBehind you!\r
My plan to spook you didn't go over\nwell at all.\n
You might be tough, but let down\nyour guard at your own risk!\n
Wah!\nThat thing curled around your neck!\r...Nice scarf, kid!\r
When I toss this coin, you call it.\nHeads, we battle.\rTails, we battle!\rNow, how will this play out, my friend?\r
The coin came up tails, and like it, my\nPokémon is facedown...\n
I flipped a coin when I was ten.\nI decided to live in Sinnoh then.\n
Luck wasn't with me last time, but I'm\nfeeling good about this.\fMy lucky coin tells me so!\r
For the sake of my collection, I\ntake on people I know I can't beat.\fThat's what a Collector does.\r
That attack right then was remarkable!\nYou ought to be proud of it!\n
I take pride in having Pokémon that\nothers don't.\rOh, I'm also proud about winning second\nprize in one of Jubilife TV's drawings.\n
For the sake of my collection, I\nkeep battling people I can't beat.\rThat's what a Collector does.\r
What's that?!\rYou say you have a Pokédex?\nAn authentic one!\r
Your Pokédex fills me with such envy,\nenvy, envy...\n
There's all kinds of Trainers with all\nsorts of Pokémon with them.\rThe more you battle, the more your\nPokédex is filled!\n
Ooh, thank you!\rYou came back to show me your Pokédex\nbecause I don't have one!\r
To find my favorite Pokémon, I'll go\neast, west, or any which way!\r
But they're rare Pokémon!\n
If you're trying to find the Pokémon\nyou want, you need to go everywhere!\rNot just east and west, either.\nSouth and north are important, too!
For my favorite Pokémon, I'll go\neast, west, or any which way!\r...Saying that, I've been wandering\naround here all this time.\r
Oh? A little kid like you is going to\nteach me about Pokémon?\r
Wow, is that right?\n
There are so many kinds of Pokémon.\nI can't decide which one to pamper.\n
Yoohoo, little kid! Can you teach me\nsome more about Pokémon?\r
                          
                 
                         
                        
               
                               
                         
                   
                    
                               
                       
                      
                               
                              
                            
                                                      
You come along with your heart\npounding!\rYou think you can win like that?!\nHiyah!\r
Gurgle...\n
If I lose here, I wouldn't stand a\nchance at the Battle Frontier.\rNot against those hard-core pros,\nI wouldn't!\n
Am I lost, you ask?\nI merely feigned it! Hiyah!\r
Check the sharpness of my fighting\nPokémon's moves.\r
You've dulled its sharpness...\n
Back to training for us!\n
I sharpened my Pokémon's moves more\nfor when I saw you again!\r
Every drop of sweat I shed makes\nme that much stronger!\r
I should be lighter by the amount of\nsweat I just shed!\r
It's time for another workout.\nThe more I sweat, the tougher I get!\n
We're going to win this time!\rDon't believe me?\nThen you test it out!\r
Hufff-huff, huff-huff.\nWant-huff a battle-huff?\r
Huff-huff, we-huff lose-huff.\n
Bye-huff now-huff.\nHuff-huff, huff-huff.\n
Running-huff is-huff good-huff.\nOver-huff doing-huff it isn't-huff!\fHuff-huff, huff-huff.\n
Huff-huff, huff-huff.\nWe-huff meet-huff again-huff?\r
I'll take on anyone!\nIt can only make me stronger!\r
You won and I lost, but the both of\nus gained something from this.\n
In a Pokémon battle, it doesn't\nmatter how old or young you are.\rYour gender doesn't matter, either.\nNothing like that means anything!\n
I'll battle against people who've\nbeaten me again and again.\rBy doing that, we both grow a little\nas Trainers.\r
I'm taking the Veilstone Gym\nchallenge. But first...\r
...My confidence is crushed.\n
I think about Pokémon all day long.\nI was confident, you know.\n
Oh, it's you again!\rI've regained my confidence.\nLet's have another battle!\r
I'm a treasure hunter.\rToday, the loot is a victory from\nyou!\r
I can't win.\nYou're too strong for me to win.\n
If one's after treasures, maybe the\nUnderground is the better choice.\n
I'm a treasure hunter.\rThis time for sure, the loot is\nvictory over you!\r
If I battle now, won't it mess up my\nusual pace?\r
My pace is completely off...\n
Sticking to one's own goal is more\nimportant than it seems.\rIf you match your goal with someone\nelse, you'll lose your identity.\n
Well, yes, sometimes I do walk.\nI even stop on occasion.\rI am human, after all.\n
Up till now, I'd maintained my pace.\nBut seeing you threw me off!\r
                        
                              
                       
I'm an elite battler, but cold is\nmy nemesis!\r
But, how...?\nAm I weak at battling, too?\n
I'd rather be asleep in the lodge's\nbed...\rI can't take this cold...\n
I'm an elite at battling, but cold is\nmy nemesis!\r
I always play for keeps!\nThis isn't practice!\r
Good job!\nThat was an excellent battle.\n
If you don't play for keeps, you'll\nlose battles you should be dominating.\n
When I lost to you last time, I was\nbattling for keeps.\rBut this time, I really mean it.\nThis is seriously for keeps!\r
I'm fully kitted up and equipped!\nAnytime will be fine!\r
Hunh?!\n
Perhaps I should maybe change into\na more comfy outfit...\n
I'm fully equipped again today!\nAnytime you're ready will be fine!\r
To be ready to answer any call!\nTo be ready to accept any challenge!\rThat is the way of a Trainer!\r
Oh, yeah?\nEat snowball, punk!\n
You can make all the preparations in\nthe world, but if it doesn't work, it\fdoesn't work.\n
I got everything ready so we could\nhave a rematch whenever you come.\r
I'm skiing right now, but OK.\nAs we Skiers say, “Spur thing!”\r
...I've hit an ice patch!\n
I quite enjoyed that battle!\nLet us meet again. Slalom!\n
We might get snowbound, but why not?\nIt's on the “spur” of the moment!\r
Are you a novice?\nOr around midlevel?\r
I never expected you to be an\nexpert...\n
You know how to play your Pokémon\nwith an edge!\n
Knowing you to be an expert,\nI challenge you to a rematch!\r
The fun things about winter!\nOne, skiing! Two, Pokémon!\r
Snivel...
If it was skiing, I wouldn't lose.\nI should go ski with my Pokémon...\n
You're a better Trainer than a skier.\nBut I'll challenge you again anyway!\r
How do you expect to battle in this\nheavy snow?\r
The winds of victory shifted...\n
It's so cold here, but here you are,\nso full of energy.\rI guess you kids are made tougher\nthan people my age.\n
Why would you wander around here?\nYou must really like this area.\r
I can withstand this cold. That means\nI can take any kind of attack!\r
Huh? It's over, you say?\n
Oh, gosh, this is bad! I think I'm\nlosing feeling all over my body!\n
Oh? I've seen your face before.\nWhat say we battle?\r
This cold is but nothing compared\nto the fire that burns in my heart!\r
Your heart burns as hot as mine!\n
The weather clears up sometimes.\nThe view is breathtaking then.\n
We'll come at you with our hearts\nablaze!\r
Wh-what is it?\nP-Pokémon battle?!\r
Whew...\nYou are alive, aren't you?\n
Around these parts, perhaps because\nof all the snow, there are many\ffolktales of hauntings...\n
This isn't like last time. See how\nmuch I've trained since then!\r
I'll show you the techniques I had\ndrummed into me at ski school!\r
I don't believe it...\nMy techniques were rebuffed...\n
Maybe I should've studied at the\nTrainers' school instead...\n
Since I lost to you last time,\nI redid my training at ski school!\r
We Skiers feel Mother Nature through\nthe soles of our feet!\r
I got a good taste of your power!\n
Trainers get an appreciation of life\nthrough Pokémon. At least I think so.\n
I knew you were headed here.\nI felt it with the soles of my feet!\r
I've been skiing with Pokémon since\nI was just five years old.\r
Hunh, what...?\nI repeat, hunh, what...?\n
The scenery doesn't change very much\naround here. Don't go getting lost!\n
Oh... Did you maybe get lost again?\nYou should pay more attention!\r
Rainy days make me feel blue...\rBut the instant it starts to snow,\nI'm as happy as can be!\r
The conditions weren't very good.\n
Can any of your Pokémon use that\nhidden move to climb cliffs?\n
You really must like snow.\rAfter all, if you didn't, I doubt that\nyou'd come here so often!\r
Poof!\rYou've got a good eye spotting me!\r
You also saw through my weak\nspots...\n
I'll play with my Pokémon--even in a\nblizzard!\n
Poof!\rYou saw through my camouflage again!\r
There are several clans of ninjas.\nAre you from the Iga clan? Or Kouga?\r
I'm not much of a ninja either way...\n
I wonder why everyone stops being\na ninja when they grow up?\n
I forged my willpower in the snow!\nWitness my snowy might!\r
I dress light wherever I go.\nHiyah!\r
Achoo!\n
Maybe I'll dress warm and come back.\nHiyah!\n
Lightly dressed like always.\nHiyah!\r
                              
       
                    
                                
         
                 
                                           
         
                          
                                    
            
                       
Yeah, yeah...\nNothing's biting!\r
Can't catch a fish!\nCan't catch a break!\n
I was counting on strength in numbers,\nbut...\rPacking it in and going home sounds good\nat a time like this...\n
Yeah, yeah...\nNothing's biting today either.\r
                                   
     
                  
                                             
                                 
     
              
                
Outdoor fishing for the win!\rShouting doesn't help my fishing any,\nbut shout I must!\r
Gwaaah!\nThis is hurting!\n
Oh, right... My shouting is scaring\naway the Pokémon.\n
Super outdoor fishing!\nShouting still doesn't help!\r
Let it rock!\nIt's the rhythm of battle!\r
Can you hear it?\nThat's my guitar weeping...\n
I'm too torn up to sing anymore...\nI am so cool that way...\n
Rock 'n' roll!\nWe'll beat it out again!\fOur rhythm of battle!\r
A man of the sea is also a man of\nPokémon!\r
Anchors away!\n
You've got what it takes to be\na Trainer among Trainers!\n
Hard to starboard!\nThat's a sharp turn to the right!\rHard to port!\nAnd that's a sharp turn to the left!\r
                 
                          
                               
                                         
              
                               
                      
       
                          
I love my inflatable tube.\nSo I admire jellyfish Pokémon!\r
I'm drifting away...\n
I wish Professor Rowan would\ngive me a Pokédex.\rBut that old guy looks kind of\nscary.\n
I love my inflatable tube.\nSo I admire jellyfish Pokémon.\rWon't you hang out with us and just\nbob around on the waves?\r
I can't swim without my inflatable tube.\nBut my Pokémon might be strong!\r
They weren't tough, my Pokémon...\n
My mommy said that Professor Rowan\nis really kindhearted.
Oh! You're the Trainer who played\nwith us before!\rCan you see if my Pokémon have grown\nstronger?\r
I only live to swim. Teach me what's\nso fun about Pokémon!\r
Oh, yeah, that was fun!\nI learned something good!\n
It's what I live for!\nPokémon!\n
Hey, didn't you teach me what's so fun\nabout Pokémon?\rTeach me more.\nI'm eager to learn!\r
On your marks, get set, go!\r...When I say that, let's start.\r
Yow-ow-ow-ow!\nMy leg's cramped up!\n
I forgot to do my stretching\nexercises...\n
Hi, I was waiting for you!\nReady? On your marks, get set...\r
OK! Get your breathing in order!\nOK! You're ready to go!\r
I let my momentum falter...\n
Listen, I have something important to\nsay to you.\rDon't drown in your own talent.\n
OK! You're ready to go!\nThis time, I'm going for the win!\r
Swimming is a workout for your entire\nbody.\rJump in and swim!\nSwim, you!\r
Sunk like a stone!\n
Well, Pokémon's one thing, but you\nshould take up swimming, too!\n
Hiya, Pokémon-riding Trainer!\nYou should be swimming like me!\r
The human body floats more easily in\nthe sea, so it's easy to swim!\r
The sea is salty, but all I taste is\nbitterness...\n
I've got that sinking feeling...\n
Pokémon can stay afloat even while\ncarrying someone. That's so cool!\r
I may not look it now, but I'm a\nstar. I'm always with my Pokémon.\r
I lost, but at least I had fun.\n
If it were an underwater Pokémon\nshow, I would have shined.\n
Oh, hi! Are you back to see our\nPokémon show again?\r
I bought a new bikini!\nIt's this year's newest model!\r
Psssssh!\n
I bought the wrong size of bikini.\nIt's a little too snug...\n
Did I show you already?\nMy bikini, new for this year!\r
                              
                  
                             
                               
                     
              
                
                 
Well? Does it look like I'm swimming\ngracefully?\r
I'm finally feeling fatigued...\n
I may look like I'm swimming\ngracefully, but beneath the surface\fI'm kicking furiously.\n
You were attracted by my graceful\nswimming again, weren't you?\r
One thing about Water-type Pokémon:\nThere's a huge variety!\rI'll show you the Water-type Pokémon I\nchose and why I'm so proud of them!\r
I can't boast when I lose...\nI'm so disappointed...\n
Sure I lost, but watch me! I'll get\ntougher with water Pokémon.\n
This time, my water Pokémon will show\nyou why I'm so proud of them!\r
I like fishing, no question.\nBut battling? That's what I love!\r
Sploosh!\n
If you don't know how to fish, you're\nmissing half of life's enjoyment.\rIf you don't know Pokémon...\nYou're missing out on all of it!\n
Come on, battle me again!\nYou know I love to fish and battle!\r
                                
        
                                   
They call me an Ace Trainer.\rAllow me to demonstrate the talent\nthat makes me so!\r
I'm burning with jealousy over your\nraw talent!\n
I think keeping up the effort to\nbetter yourself is a talent in itself.\n
Last time, I stumbled before I could\nshowcase my talent.\rThis time, I'll conclusively demonstrate\nthe might of an Ace Trainer!\r
Really? So you think you can beat me?\nI'm an Ace Trainer, you do realize?\r
I admit defeat...\n
Beaten in battle, but not in spirit.\nThat's the mark of a real Ace Trainer.\n
Ace Trainers always work to improve\ntheir natural-born talents.\r
Are you going to the Pal Park, too?\rFor you, I'm willing to show off my\nprized Pokémon!\r
So? Hot stuff, huh?\nThat's why I'm so proud of my Pokémon!\n
Pal Park, huh? I wonder what kinds\nof Pokémon you can see there?\n
Listen, did you go to the Pal Park?\nWhat was it like? What was it like?\r
Well, I am fishing, but...\rVery well!\nI accept your challenge!\r
A bittersweet smile is on my lips.\n
I've gone down in defeat.\nWhatever more is there to say?\n
Well, just as before, I'm fishing, but...\rVery well!\nI accept your challenge!\r
Hi, traveler!\nHow would you like to battle?\r
You've bested this fisherman traveler.\n
I like to fish.\nYou're a traveler.\rFarewell, until we meet again!\n
Hi, traveler!\rI've forgotten your name, but we've\nbattled before, haven't we?\r
I'm getting bored of fishing.\nLet's have a quick battle!\r
I've been done in...\n
Thanks for that!\nIt was a good change of pace for me.\n
Yo! I remember how our battle was a\ngood change of pace before.\rLet's have another quick battle!\r
If I stare at the water's surface\nfor too long, I begin to forget what\fI was doing in the first place.\r
I don't know how, but I lost!\n
Oh, right...\nI was fishing, wasn't I?\n
When I looked up from staring at the\nwater's surface, I saw your face.\rI'm not sure about what I was just\ndoing, but do you want to battle?\r
                    
    
                
                
      
                 
                                                                      
                       
                                                        
                                 
     
                               
My dream's a big one!\rI want to battle every kind of Pokémon\nfrom around the world!\r
I lost, but I am one step closer to\nrealizing my dream!\n
Listen, you! Whatever happens, never\nlose sight of your dream!\n
All right, you!\rHelp me realize my dream of battling\nevery kind of Pokémon there is!\r
Oh, we'll ride upon the sea,\nin a boat, just you and me!\rThat's the way of the Sailor!\nWay of the Sailor. Sing it!\r
Your Pokémon...\nThey're looking good!\n
You ought to think about becoming\na Sailor yourself.\rIt's been great to be able to visit\ndifferent places around the world.\n
Oh, we'll ride upon the sea,\nin a boat, just you and me!\rThat's the way of the Sailor!\nWay of the Sailor. You sing, too!\r
Who's there?!\nWhat do you think you're doing?!\r
I happen to be rather jumpy, so\neveryone looks suspicious to me.\n
I'm easy to scare, and yet here I am\non patrol. Funny how things go.\n
At night, I get tense and nervous.\nI don't know why.\n
I'll repeat myself! Who's there?!\nWhat do you think you're doing?!\r
I need to escape these doldrums...\nYou can keep me company.\r
That did liberate me from the doldrums,\nbut at what price...\n\n
I'm going back to the hotel to rest!\nI find you exceedingly tiresome!\n
I'm afraid I'm in the doldrums again.\nYou shall keep me company again!\r
                                 
            
                                             
                                
                       
                               
After enjoying a meal at the hotel\nrestaurant, one has a battle.\rThat's the social etiquette.\r
Enchanting.\n
Personally, I would much rather pamper\nPokémon than make them battle.\n
I only seem to run into you after\nI go to the restaurant.\rEtiquette calls for a battle after a\nmeal. Shall we?\r
Look, look! Look at my Pokémon!\nIt's really cool!\r
Wowee! I had to hold on tight to\nmy inflatable tube!\n
Pools are OK, but I like the sea\nbecause Pokémon live there.\n
Yay! You came to see my Pokémon\nagain, right? Look, look!\r
Listen, listen! Can you tell me what\nkind of Pokémon you have?\r
You're so tough. I'm stunned...\n
I want to hang on to a BUIZEL and\njust bob around.\n
Listen, listen! Did you find any new\nkinds of Pokémon?\r
                          
           
                               
                            
                
                   
                                 
                 
                 
                  
                           
I came out here because I wanted to\nsee the Pokémon League for myself.\r
I'm shocked...\nNo, really, I am.\n
The way I battle now, well, I can\nonly look at the Pokémon League!\rYou, go on! You go to the Pokémon\nLeague for me, too!\n
I've been training here in hopes of\ngoing to the Pokémon League.\r
I've decided!\nI'm off to the Pokémon League if I win!\r
Blblblblugh...\n
It's OK. Just let me float away\nlike driftwood...\n
This is it! I'm going to beat you, then\nI'm off to the Pokémon League!\r
It might not look like it, but I'm\ntraveling now.\r
You've got the upper hand on me.\n
But you can be sure that there will\nbe bigger challenges in front of you.\rGo! Go as far as you can! You alone can\nbroaden your horizons.\n
I'm still on my journey...\nLet's have a battle!\r
The sea around these parts is harsh.\nAs am I!\r
The world is so harsh...\n
What? You've got that many Gym\nBadges? No wonder you're so tough...\n
It's me again! The harsh sea here\nshould have toughened me up more!\r
To swim every sea there is...\nThat's my dream!\r
Boo!\nI'm not done with my dream!\n
What is the sea like in places like the\nKanto and Hoenn regions?\n
Challenging every Pokémon League...\nThat's another of my dreams!\r
Yes, I know I can surf, but I'd\nrather swim instead.\rIt does seem weird, I agree.\r
Kaploosh!\n
If you don't know how, I'm willing to\nshow you how to swim.\n
If you rely on your Pokémon all the\ntime, you'll never learn how to swim!\r
I train at a Pokémon Gym, too.\rDon't think you're going to win\neasily!\r
Master Wake...\nI mean, Crasher Wake, sorry!\n
What to do... Train at the Gym again,\nor train by myself...\n
I trained at the Gym after you beat\nme. Let's do it, gang!\r
I'm determined to go to the Pokémon\nLeague, no matter how hard it is.\r
Th-this is so hard...\n
Losing won't make me quit.\nI mean, this is my dream!\rThe Pokémon League isn't going\nanywhere, either.\n
It doesn't matter how long it takes,\nI'm going to the Pokémon League!\r
Excuse me for wearing my bikini!\r
Was I multitasking too much, battling\nand swimming at the same time?\n
When I'm in my bikini, I'm at a loss\nabout where to carry my Poké Balls!\n
Giggle...\nExcuse me for wearing my bikini!\r
Deep breathing before battle!\nBreathe in...and out!\r
Breathe in...and out.\nBreathe in...and out!\n
Deep breathing after battle, too!\nBreathe in...and out!\n
Deep breathing always!\nBreathe in...and out!\r
Your Pokémon doesn't seem to be tiring\nat all from carrying you on its back.\rLet me see how strong it is!\r
I can't take any more...\nI'm all tired out!\n
While floating here, I think about\neverything and nothing.\rLike how I should battle next, and\nwhat's for dinner tomorrow, and...\n
How much stronger have your Pokémon\nbecome?\rLet me check 'em out, OK?\r
Did you know, I was crowned the\nchampion of a swimsuit contest!\rSo now, I'm trying to win a title\nat a Pokémon Contest!\r
I'm speechless!\nI never lose when I'm in my swimsuit!\n
I shouldn't be worried about what bikini\nto wear.\rThe first thing to do is consider what\nPokémon I should be using!\n
I'm so wonderful, I won a swimsuit\ncontest.\rI'm going to take you on so that I can\nwin a Pokémon Contest!\r
My favorite kind of guy is someone\nthat looks good out on the open sea!\r
The tide is going out...\n
Don't get me wrong, it's not as if I\ndon't like mountain men.\rBut, you know, my most favorite kind of\nguy looks great with Pokémon!\n
Hello again! You're that Trainer who\nlooks keen with your Pokémon!\r
Fine, all righty then.\nJust a quick battle on my break!\r
Wahaha!\nMercy, I cry mercy!\n
I'd better get on back to work...\rYou know, I'd rather be traveling\naround with Pokémon the way you do.\n
I'm gonna let you in on a secret...\nI snuck my Pokémon to work!\r
Well, now aren't you something!\n
OK, OK, time for work! I'll work up\na thirst with my Pokémon!\n
                           
              
                 
                           
                
                           
                                 
           
                               
                                                
                          
                         
What's cool, you might ask? No?\nI'll tell you anyway: bug Pokémon!\r
Don't ignore bug Pokémon!\nThat really bugs me!\n
It would seem that coolness alone\ndoesn't add up to any wins...\n
Here comes the swarm!\r
Whoooh...\n
There's a Pokémon ability named Swarm.\n
My senses tingle...\nI've spotted a rare Pokémon!\r
Awawawawah...\n
I thought it was a rare Pokémon, but\nit turned out to be just a Trainer!\n
We're just out on a power walk!\r
Oh, you!\n
You can't avoid bug Pokémon ever in\nthe forest.\rI didn't have any Antidotes with me,\neither. It was the worst!\n
When a Trainer and a Pokémon bond\nas one, a wondrous power is born...\r
Urmmm...\nUrrrrmmmmm...\n
There still remain many mysteries yet\nto be solved in this strange world...\n
A strange presence has been felt...\nIt is emanating from...you!\r
Oh, no!\nMy MEDITITE!
The Old Chateau... I sense...\na particularly strong presence there.
I see it...\nI see it...\rI see you going down in defeat...\r
It is I that has gone down in defeat.
The Old Chateau...\nThere should be none alive in it...\rAnd yet there is a pervasive sense of\na presence...
This forest is strange, you know...\nIt seems to fill me with energy...\r
Your victory...\nThere is nothing strange about it.
Forests are mystifying... They seem\nto gather such unexplainable energy.
                         
               
                               
                                  
                            
                 
                             
                                  
                        
                 
                                                
                  
                 
                                           
                              
               
                                 
                             
            
                   
                                
                
                            
                                             
                
                
                                 
            
                        
                                       
               
                                 
                                                 
                  
                      
                           
        
                                   
                                               
               
                                   
                                                           
              
                                
                  
               
                            
                  
             
                          
                             
    
            
                                   
              
                                        
                         
                             
               
               
                  
You... One look at you tells me\nyou're a real contender!\r
You're as tough as you look.
One day, people will run to the other\nside of the road when I walk by 'em.\rIt's a goal of mine I'm working on.
Victory Road... Somehow, it feels as\nif my journey is now coming to an end.\rBut, before the final chapter is\nwritten, I must pen your defeat!\r
That wasn't how I planned the final\nchapter to go in my writing class...
If you don't give up, you can reach\nyour goal.\rThat perseverance is what's important\nto Trainers. That's in my book, too.
Show me how you've battled to get\nhere! Let's do this!\r
So, that's how you battled...?\n
Once you emerge from Victory Road,\nthe Pokémon League lies directly\fahead...\rBut many Trainers fail to ever find\ntheir way on Victory Road...\n
This total stranger'll be a good way\nto see if I have what it takes to own\fthe Pokémon League's Elite Four!\r
That battle just now must make you\ntougher than everyone in the world.\n
It doesn't appear as if anyone could\neven try to stand against your might.\rThe Elite Four should just surrender.
I can sense that your Pokémon have\na lot of trust in you.\rYou and your Pokémon...\nYou seem to be aglow.\r
Ah, I understand it now!\n
Neither Pokémon nor people live\nforever.\rBut it is the very frailty of life that\nallows us to shine!
Let me see how well your Pokémon can\nbattle!\r
Brilliant!\n
Rather than navigating Victory Road,\nI have a much better time putting\fyoung Trainers like you to the test.\n
I take Pokémon that are tough to begin\nwith and toughen them up even more.\rYou can help me!\r
There's no way I could have won!\n
How should I teach the most powerful\nof the Dragon-type moves...?\n
This is a place where tough Trainers\nnaturally congregate.\rIt's ideal for training!\r
That's why I like it here; I get to\nbattle tough characters like you.\n
When two roads diverge, you must\nchoose the path less traveled...\n
My Pokémon knows karate!\nI'm warning you, it's a tough one!\r
I've met my match in strength!\n
I've made it this far in life using the\nkarate I learned on the Internet!\n
I keep battling so I can soar\never higher into the skies!\r
It seems I've been grounded...\n
The wings of freedom...\rI know I'll find them if I can win\nmy way through the Pokémon League...\n
I am a Psychic!\nI can see your future!\r
So be it! I will now divulge what\nI know of your future... Hmm!\n
I see it now!\rYou will battle the Elite Four of the\nPokémon League!\n
I am a Psychic!\nI can see your past!\r
Your past...\nYou've been through a lot...\n
Let me guess.\nHave you met any legendary Pokémon?\n
Pat: It's a doubles team of aces!\nWe're gonna overwhelm you!\r
Pat: You and your Pokémon will gain\npower by helping each other out.\n
Pat: The combination of you and\nyour awesome Pokémon...\rIt's the ultimate tag team!\n
Pat: If you don't mind, we're hoping\nfor some two-on-two battle action.\n
Jo: We form a combination that's\nin perfect sync!\rHow do you expect to counter that?\r
Jo: You and your Pokémon make\na beautiful combination!\n
Jo: Yup, the way you battle is\nfantastic!\rYou should try to take the Elite Four\nright now--not later!\n
Jo: We want to have a battle\nwithout an advantage.\rPlease come back when you have\nat least two Pokémon!\n
Al: I intend to perfect my Double\nBattle technique.\rThat will make me better all around.\r
Al: You! You're an expert\ndouble battler, too!\n
Al: Your mastery over several\nPokémon at once...\rYou're a remarkable Trainer!\n
Al: You have but one Pokémon?\rI would say that you are taking\nVictory Road too lightly, kid.\n
Kay: I want to improve my doubles\ntechnique as much as I can.\rThat will improve me as a Trainer.\r
Kay: My goodness!\nYou're great at doubles, too!
Kay: Depending on the combinations,\nevery kind of Pokémon can excel.\rAt least, that's what I think.\n
Kay: You're really going through\nVictory Road with only one Pokémon?\n
We Trainers will accept challenges\nanywhere! It's what we do.\r
Hmm...\nInsufficiently raised?\n
Pokémon can appear anywhere in a cave.\nIt's not like the tall grass by roads.\n
To celebrate my getting through this\ncave, I'm going to battle you!\r
Well, I guess losing is something\nto commemorate, too...\n
Getting through that cave feels\nlike an adventure.\n
I'm a Veteran, yes, but don't you\ndare treat me like a senior citizen!\r
Grrr...\nSo young, and yet so talented!\n
I'll always remain young at heart.\nNever let them say you're too old!\n
                                                       
          
                        
                                         
              
                                        
                         
               
               
Oh, what's this? My last one!\nThis is where we make our stand!\r
We're not done yet!\nThere's no giving up!\n
Hmm!\nMy sturdy Pokémon, defeated!\n
Aiyaah! We're coming out swinging\nwith super-heavy judo chops!\r
That was...\nA complete trashing!\n
I must rededicate myself to training.\nThe road extends into infinity...\n
Up and down you go on the lifts.\nMe? I like to battle!\r
You've got me feeling down!\n
I can't keep this up!\nI'll go back to working on the lifts.\n
A Pokémon Gym isn't only about seeing\nhow tough your Pokémon happen to be.\rIt's so much deeper than just that.\nIt's a test of you as a person.\r
That move was devastating!\n
I get to work all day with my\nPokémon, and even battle sometimes.\rI get all the fun I need every day!
An ace has the knowledge and\nexperience of battling at high levels.\rI'll demonstrate what that means to\na noob like you!\r
Wow...\nI'm in the mood to sing a lullaby...\n
Your earnest enthusiasm...\nI guess that kinda makes you an ace.\rMaybe you're a Trainer who has the\npotential to surpass aces!\n
By focusing on only one type, you can\nreally see the strengths and\fweaknesses of that Pokémon.\r
My focus was too narrow minded...
Start by becoming friendly with your\nPokémon. I mean really friendly.\rIf you do that, you'll learn naturally\nhow you should battle with it.\n
Steel represents an unbending spirit!\rIf one refuses to accept defeat,\nthe path to victory reveals itself!\r
I never gave up, but still I failed to\nwin...\n
If you give up, well, that's when\neverything ends for you!\n
Pokémon and people have worked\ntogether for many years.\rLet us show you an example of that\nhistory!\r
A spectacular loss!\nBut it's still a loss!\n
The way you helped each other...\nThat is what made you prevail!\n
What do you think you're doing to my\nPokémon?!
This can't be?! I lost?!\nYou...you uppity brat!\n
Oi! This is no fun and games!\nThis is proper work, I tell you!\r
What...?!\nSome brat messed up my job...\n
Team Galactic needs electricity for\ndoing something big!\n
Collecting electricity from the Valley\nWindworks... That's our mission.\r
I really don't like kids who also\nhappen to be tough Trainers...\n
You don't have an inkling of what\nTeam Galactic is trying to achieve!\rOf course, they don't tell a grunt\nlike me anything, either... But still!\n
...This is why I'm gonna be stuck as\na grunt forever...\n
...I want a promotion so I can get some\ntougher Pokémon...\n
Don't get cocky!\nThis isn't over yet!\n
My Pokémon's getting low on HP...\nThings could be tight here.\n
What just happened?\nI lost?!\n
Don't get cocky!\nThis isn't over yet!\n
My Pokémon's getting low on HP...\nThings could be tight here.\n
What just happened?\nI lost?!\n
We were having a heated discussion\nover Pokémon the way Collectors do.\r
Knowledge alone isn't everything,\nyou know...\n
I'm more knowledgeable than anyone\nelse!\rI have a rare Pokémon!\rBut, I'm weak at battling...\nThat's a Pokémon Collector for you...
I'm a Collector, and I love Honey!\r
What've you done to my Pokémon?!\rIt took me forever to catch it using\nHoney!\n
I went through a lot of bother to catch\nmy Pokémon.\rBut since I've not raised it, it's\nas weak as when I caught it.\n
Welcome!\nThis place is my pride and joy!\r
I take losses with an unusually big\nsmile! Do you find that odd at all?\n
After a match, you should have some\nMoomoo Milk to quench your thirst!\rJust chug it right down! Glug glug!\n
                                                                   
                   
                              
                                                                
                   
                                 
                                                                  
                   
                                   
                            
                 
                   
                                 
                   
                  
It's not the end yet.
Are you saying something?\nYou think you have me cornered?\n
Amazing!\nYou're very good, aren't you?\n
Giggle! You found me!\nOf course, let's battle!\r
Aww, boo!\nLook, you've beaten me!\n
Giggle! There's only our Gym Leader\nleft. Go on, don't be afraid!\n
A forest inside a Gym...\nShocking, isn't it?\r
Giggle...\nThe clock will turn now.\n
OK, the next Trainer is at the end,\npast two boulders.\n
My Grass-type Pokémon can dole out\nspecial attacks...\rI won't let you win easily!\r
The more beautiful a flower,\nthe faster it withers...\n
Oh, that's right...\nA hint about the next Trainer...\rIn the middle of three trees.\nThat's my hint. Good luck.\n
Even concealed, there is no hiding\nthe aroma of flowers.\r
Just like your inability to conceal\nyour abundant skill.\n
Your next opponent is under four\nflowers.\n
Hey! That there!\nThat was a good move!\n
This is where it gets exciting!\n
Hunwah!\nIt's gone and ended!\rHow will I say this... I want more!\nI wanted to battle a lot more!\n
I've landed the most fish Pokémon\nin the world. I'm next!\r
Being number one in the world doesn't\nmean a thing...\n
I figure I got too wrapped up in\nfishing and neglected training.\n
I wield the stupendous power of water!\nDon't think you can win!\r
But the kid wins anyway!\nI'm just bowled over!\n
The water rising and falling is tricky,\nbut don't let it annoy you.\rIf you lose sight of yourself, that's\nwhen you're set to lose.\n
I've been around the world, going from\nplace to place training Pokémon.\rIt's this Gym I've chosen to make my\nhome!\rYou can bet it's tough!\r
You!\nYou're truly top-class tough!\n
If you were to go around the world,\nI'm sure you'd meet tougher Pokémon.\n
Like the raging sea, I crash down\nand wash away everything before me!\rThat's just how I roll!\r
That wave didn't even wash\nmy hands...\n
I'm now becalmed like a waveless\nsea...\n
My body isn't the only thing I\nwork on toughening up here.\rI also work on my Pokémon and my\nspirit!\r
Wow, Trainer! You just might be\ntougher than our Gym Leader!\n
Maybe I'll do like Wake,\rI mean, Crasher Wake, and wear\nthe same kind of mask.\n
I want to become a strong Trainer\nlike Crasher Wake!\r
Groan...\nYou're too much.\n
Maybe I'll do like Wake...\rI mean, Crasher Wake, and use\nthe same kinds of Pokémon.\n
                                              
                     
                           
                                
      
                                  
                                                              
                           
                              
                                  
                      
                                 
Oh!\nBut this isn't the end, my friend!\n
I'm in a bit of a bind, aren't I?\n
I shall admit defeat...\nYou are much too strong.\n
We're the Karate Quads!\rI will strike a blow for love with my\nfist! Hiyah, looooooooove!\r
Argh! Crunched!\n
Your Pokémon sure are tough!\rBut our Gym Leader Maylene will\nbreak you like a stack of bricks!\n
We're the Karate Quads!\rI will strike a blow for courage with\nmy fist! Hiyah, couraaaaaaaaaaage!\r
I couldn't force my way to victory...\n
To overwhelm by force...\nThat is my ideal beat-down style.\rIt doesn't seem to work that way\nwith Pokémon, however.\n
We're the Karate Quads!\rI will strike a blow for hope with my\nfist! Hiyah, hoooooooooooooope!\r
We came up short, but not by much.\n
I'll have to redo my training, though.\nMaylene's gonna trample me again...\n
We're the Karate Quads!\rI will strike a blow for tears with\nmy fist! Hiyah, teeeeeeaaaaaaaaars!\r
I'm so hungry, kid...\nI don't have any strength left...\n
I lost because I didn't eat\nenough pizza.\r...No. Anything I say will sound\nlike I'm making excuses.
Oh, heavens. What is this?\nIs this my final Pokémon?\n
Never give up, never surrender!\n
You are so fantastically strong.\nI know now why I have lost.\n
I've been to all sorts of places.\nThat means I know tons of things!\r
Yeah, whatever.\nYou can battle, too...\n
I'm gonna visit new places and find\nnew Pokémon so I'll be a know-it-all!\n
What, were you just dawdling around\nhoping I'd notice you for a battle?\rYou know you're going to get whupped\nhere, don't you?\r
I kinda deserved that, didn't I?\nI gotta stop mouthing off like that...\n
I'll remember you and your shifty\nPokémon, too. I'm watching you...\n
What does it feel like, taking one step\nafter another into darkness?\r
You're the kind of person who can keep\ngoing forward even into the unknown.\n
I think, sometimes, one has to make\nmistakes to learn what is right.\n
Boo! Did I scare you?\nThis battle will!\r
Uh, whoopsie!\nThat didn't end well!\n
Since you're here, you might as well\ntake on every Trainer.\n
I'm not afraid of picnicking anywhere,\nso I've learned all sorts of things.\r
Your toughness...\nIt's something new to me.
I've learned that Pokémon are fun\n'cause everyone plays with 'em!\n
Are you lost?\nAre you enjoying yourself?\r
Let me guess.\nYou are enjoying yourself.\n
Whatever happens in life, it's better to\ntry to enjoy it the best one can.\rBeing in the dark here, I came to\nrealize that.\n
Eek! That's so bright!\rSurprise attack!\r
Your strength is dazzling!\nI have to shield my eyes!\n
I'm going over the reasons why I\nlost. That way, I'll win next time.\n
Hey, now!\nYou're not even close to the door yet.\rYou have to beat me before you can\ngo, you know?\r
Argh! I should've dazzled you by\nshining my light in your eyes!\n
Just walk around and look for the blue\nmarks on the tiles.\n
I'm going to break the ice and bring\nout my last-resort Pokémon!\n
I can sense your will to win, but I\npromise you I'm not about to lose!\n
I must say, I've warmed up to you!\nI might even admire you a little.\n
...It's t-too cold.\nI can't even feel my t-tongue.\r
This result...\n...It's cold. Bitter cold.\n
The higher up you slide from, the\nmore speed you'll have to smash\fthose big snowballs.\n
My willpower was shaped and tempered\nby howling blizzards.\rI'll bring it to bear on you!\r
You weren't even fazed...\n
I've battled countless Trainers\nand many more Pokémon still.\rMy spirit has been hardened from all\nthe battles I have fought.
Is the Gym's trick floor making you\na little hot under the collar?\rIf you can't maintain your cool in\nbattle, you'll freeze up.\r
You were surprisingly cool...\nAt least I have my warm boots.\n
Your Pokémon look so hot in battle.\nSo hot, they're cool! Hahah!
Are you feeling all run-down?\rBut a good Trainer is one who wins no\nmatter the situation!\r
That's right. A good Trainer will win,\nno matter what the situation may be.\n
The Trainer's feelings...\nThe Pokémon's feelings...\rIf they are one and the same, you\nwill never lose.\n
                                 
                     
                           
                                             
         
                                                                   
I get it! You guys are tough!\nBut we can match your toughness!\n
This is it!\nMy trump card!\n
Shocking... I didn't see this coming!\n
You've got me beat...\rYour desire and the noble way\nyour Pokémon battled for you...\rI even felt thrilled during our\nmatch.\rThat was a very good battle.\n
Wow! I'm surprised you've come this\nfar, but you'll have to turn back.\rThere isn't any chance that you\ncould ever beat me!\r
What makes your Pokémon\nso special?\n
As a challenger, you're one tough\nTrainer.\n
I'm not just looking for tough\nTrainers to battle.\rI've been battling here because\nI want to feel the rush!\r
Your power is thrilling...\nI'm thrilled down to my toes!\n
I'm so glad that there are Pokémon!\rThere isn't much else that gives me\nthe thrill that Pokémon do!\n
I want to win!\nThat desire I pour into my guitar!\rI want to win!\nThat passion compels my Pokémon!\r
We couldn't win...\nNo encores for us...\n
The Trainer's desire to win!\rIf you don't lose that, there's\nno limit on what you can become!\n
Spark!\rThis is what our Gym Leader did\nto the Gym out of boredom!\r
Spark...\n
We were lacking energy...\rNo, we lacked more than that. We\ndidn't want the win enough.\n
Whether you're a Trainer or a\nGuitarist, it takes dedication to\fimprove your mad skills!\r
My skills seem to have let me down.\nI must have been out of tune!\n
The way you battle, I can feel the\nvery heart of rock and roll.\rTell me, are you maybe a fan of\nrocking out?\n
Look at the way I'm dressed.\nCan't you see that I'm hardcore?\r
I was being serious!\nDon't laugh at me! I mean it!\n
I dress this way so I can get a feel for\nhow electric Pokémon think.\rWould you like to try, too?\n
This is the toughest Gym in Sinnoh.\rThat's why I'm here--to learn the\nbest battle techniques around!\r
...You're tough.\n
You just showed me that there's\nstill lots I need to learn.\rThe world of Pokémon is deep!\n
Can you make it to the Gym Leader?\nYou sure now?\r
The gears spin round and round...\nI spin down and out...\n
Our Gym's trick walkways are sure\nto make your head spin!\n
My dragon Pokémon chose to become\npowerful here. They sure like it!\r
Your battle style...\nSo savage...\n
It's been several years since I left\nthe Dragon's Den.\rI've got to say, your Pokémon are\nin the top class for toughness.
My dragon Pokémon chose to remain\nhere to become powerful.\r
There's something about you...\nYou're not just anybody.\rI challenge you!\r
You're at a different level of\nexpertise for sure!\n
You've won countless times...\nThat has made you very powerful.\n
There's something about you...\nYou still remain extraordinary.\rI challenge you again!\r
I constantly analyze Pokémon and\nvarious battles on my laptop.\r
...Things don't always work out\naccording to my calculations...\n
I had a lot of fun battling with\nyou, though.\rI wonder if I can analyze the\nbattle data properly?\rI could use a rematch to get\nsome additional data.\n
I analyzed our last battle on my\nlaptop.\r
For some reason I was drawn here,\nand it is here that I met you...\rI want to know what all this means!\r
I see...\rSo that's what it means...\n
I feel... I feel some sort of a mystic\npresence emanating from here...\n
Why have you come back to this spot?\nI want to know what all this means!\r
There is nothing here... And yet\nthere is a power lurking...\rWere you drawn by it, as well?\r
The power that slumbers within you...\nIt is rather marvelous indeed...\n
A place where nothing else exists...\rA place such as that is better suited\nto awaken the power within.\n
Do you see now?\nYou've come back again.\rThere must be something that draws\nyou to this place...\r
I don't care who you are--no one\ninterferes with my treasure hunting!\r
My Pokémon!\nMy treasures!\n
I heard there's an intriguing stone\nmonument around, so I came running.\n
I'm still here...and still searching\nfor treasures.\rHowever, a battle with you\nis a treasure I can't pass up!\r
All right, my Pokémon squad!\nGet out there and kick up a storm!\r
The squad failed to hit its stride...\n
Hmm...\rGazing out over the sea doesn't do a\nthing for toughening up my Pokémon!\n
Ah, it's been a long time!\rI have been toughening my fists\nagainst the sea, just as before!\r
I've seen countless Trainers and\neven more Pokémon!\rSo, what kind of a Trainer are you?\r
I see...\nSimply outstanding.
I've seen countless Trainers and\neven more Pokémon.\rYou're a strong Trainer.\nMoreover, your heart is strong.\n
I am indeed a Veteran, but I don't\nuse that as an excuse to slack off.\rI take pride in challenging those\nwho have bested me before!\r
Ugh...\nI didn't use items effectively.\n
I like to study a lot...\nI thought I could win...\n
I'll let you join my fan club if you can\nbeat me!\r
Ouch! Are you one of those loyal\nfans? You sure are rowdy!\n
Well, that's me and my Pokémon!\nThank you for being such a fan!\rJust so you know, our latest single\nis “Jigglin' Pokémon Wub”!\n
I've spotted a charismatic Trainer!\nWe just might have a scoop here!\r
My camera's too heavy.\nI couldn't battle effectively...\n
The lively expressions on you and\nyour Pokémon's faces...\rIt sure makes for some great TV!\n
Your spirit's vibes, man... I can feel\nthat you've got rock in your soul!\r
You beat me, man, but...\nI feel totally amped to jam harder!\n
Rock is about your spirit!\nBattling is about spirit, too!\fThat's why battles rock! Rawk!\n
You're live on camera, but try\nto act natural, OK?\r
The camera is our witness!\nIt's recorded our defeat...\n
I'd like to take that footage and\nhave it broadcast worldwide.\n
Two Pokémon! If you had two Pokémon,\nwe'd have a great scene to shoot!\n
So, let's begin and find out what\nsort of a Trainer you are!\r
You have a superstar quality!\nYou sure could become a celebrity!\n
I lost, but I'm totally thrilled!\nWe just made some great TV!\n
Oh, no. What we're looking for is you\nto battle with two Pokémon!\n
Are we all ready to have some fun?\nI sure am! Aren't you having fun?!\fLet's make it fun! OK?! Mwahahah!\r
Oh, no, no, no!\nMwahahah?\n
A clown's makeup is a face that's\ncrying while laughing. Mwahahah!\rIt defines what we do!\n
Po-Po-Pokémon!\nDo you think I'm a real Pokémon?\r
Pi-Pikachu!\n
I need to find a way to get more into\nthe character of a Pokémon...\n
Join me in this on-the-spot report,\nlive at the scene of a battle!\r
The media is the victim!\n
Interviews are about taking the\ninitiative. The people need to know.\n
How is this madness possible?\nThe two of us, losing to children?\n
This won't do... Time to retreat.\nThis mission is a failure.\n
How insolent.\nTake a bite of this, child!\n
Losing to some child...\nBeing careless cost me too much.\n
We are acquiring Pokémon for a most\nastonishing undertaking!\rYour meddling won't be tolerated!\r
I feel like I got meddled with...\n
Our astonishing undertaking is\nmost certainly breathtaking.\rIf you ever hope to see its glorious\nunveiling, then don't meddle with us!\n
                           
             
                                                       
Our objectives are incredible!\nToo incredible for me to understand!\rI'll fight blindly to defend them,\nand your intrusion won't be forgiven!\r
What was I fighting for, again?
What do you have against taking\nPokémon from others?\rLook in any field or forest!\nThose things aren't exactly rare!\n
                       
                         
                                                
So sorry, sweetie.\nTeam Galactic has no room for kiddies!\r
B-but, deary, you're just a kid!\n
You wanted to go up?\nWell, why didn't you?\n
Let's see how good this Pokémon is!\nI stole it from some weak Trainer.\r
What is this?!\n
Wimpy little Pokémon...\rWhen I get promoted, I'll demand\nbetter stolen Pokémon.\n
Why, thank you!\rWe love it when people come to us\nto donate their Pokémon!\r
What do you think you're doing?!\n
You can catch Pokémon anywhere.\nWhat's so special about them?\rTrainers that lose theirs should\nquit whining and catch some more!\n
                                               
             
                                                                      
Ancient ruins rife with the UNOWN...\nThere has to be a meaning!\rBut its significance eludes me, and\nthat's gotten me cranky!\r
The search must continue!\n
The significance of the ancient ruins...\rOnly Pokémon that look like the letters\nof some strange language...\rCan they be trying to convey a message\nto us?\n
I can't explain it...\nBeing here compels me to battle!\r
Hunh?!\nWhat was I just doing?!\n
The desire to do battle lingers on...\rDo such spirits of Pokémon still roam\nwithin these walls?\n
I need to shake off my sorrow...\nPlease, battle with me!\r
My sorrow has deepened...\n
I won't ever forget the Pokémon that\nI've spent time with, however fleeting.\n
It makes no difference where we are.\rIf you have Pokémon with you,\nI reckon you ought to battle.\r
You've got a lot of giddyap and go\nin you!\n
Over a long life, you'll be certain\nto have some sad farewells.\rBut I reckon there are also some\nnew beginnings.\n
Hahaha! I'm afraid y'all are no match\nfor us with jus' one of them Pokémon!
My Pokémon is a lively one.\nLemme show you how much!\r
Well! Aren't you the lively one!
Them graves here in Lost Tower...\nRight'n here, inside my heart...\rThose are the places where my\nPokémon remain...\n
You haven't got yerself two\nPokémon?\n
My Pokémon were taken from me...\nTeam Galactic did it...\rEver since, I've never forgiven\ntheir faces...\r
Gwaaaaaah!\n
I'm not doing my Pokémon any favors\nby ruining its memory like this...\rI can't be wallowing around forever.\nI gotta move on and turn the page.
Mike: I can't embarrass myself again.\nNot in front of my girlfriend!\r
Mike: Awww, jeez.\nMan, that's a downer...\n
Mike: Coming here again brings back\nall kinds of memories of me and Nat.\n
Mike: You can't battle with us.\nNot with one Pokémon, anyway.\n
Nat: I don't want to look bad again.\nNot when my boyfriend is watching!\r
Nat: This makes me feel hollow\ninside... Oh, so hollow...\n
Nat: The Pokémon that brought me and\nMike together is buried here...\n
Nat: You do have at least two\nPokémon, don't you?\n
Waah! Ghost! Get away! Eek!\nHelp me, team!\r
Hey...\nYou're no ghost...\n
I had to come to the Lost Tower on\na dare...\rI have to go to the top and use Defog\nthere...\n
Beating you would be my 100th\nstraight win! Here's to a fun battle!\r
How could I lose now?!\nThis is beyond aggravating!\n
I wish I could beat Maylene in\nVeilstone City one day...\n
Yeah, I like to camp! So what?\nLet's battle!\r
I should've just stuck to\ncamping out here...\n
When I'm with my Pokémon, I can camp\njust about anywhere I want!\n
If we were to battle, your Pokémon \nwould become tougher.\rLikewise, my Pokémon would also\nbecome tougher.\rIt's all good.\nThis calls for a battle!\r
You know, I would have really enjoyed\na win there. Would've been real nice.\n
This mine's been abandoned, but\nnow it's home to many Pokémon.\rI guess everything finds a place\nto call home someday...
Tough Pokémon...\nTough Trainers...\rYou tell me, where else can I find\na place as good as this to train?\r
That was good.\nYou've bonded well with your Pokémon.\n
Tough Pokémon...\nTough Trainers...\rTheir strength comes from their bond.\nAnd that's something that can be\fmade stronger anywhere.\n
I'll pound the fear of my fists into\nyou all karate style, punk!\r
I'm so sorry...\nI got a bit mouthy there, didn't I?\n
So, I'm gonna try and shatter steel!\rI wonder how many more years it\nwould take for me to do that?\n
Every good Hiker gets a boost of\nenergy when surrounded by boulders!\rWrooooar! Coming at you!\nLet me blow off some steam!\r
Whew... Crazy, delicious sugar!\nI think I've calmed down now...\n
If it's called a mountain, you can\nbe sure I'll be climbing it.\rEven if it's a mountain of food, I'll\nstill be stickin' my flag on top!\n
When you're up in the mountains,\na battle'd do for a proper greeting!\r
Yahoo!\n
Actually, when you're up in the\nmountains, a simple hi'd do if\fyou walk past someone.\rOh, and this isn't the mountains.\n
May we have a battle, please?\rIt will be something to lighten up this\nboring picnic with.\r
We're not going to win if we play\naround like that...\n
I'm going home to play with my\nPokémon!\n
The working-class hero says hi!\r
The working-class hero waves bye...\n
I used to work here a long time\nago, before it shut down.\rI worked at the ironworks near\nFloaroma Town, too.\rYou might say I'm drawn by iron\nas if by magnet!\n
While I'm making sure the lifts are\nsafe, I'll focus on a battle with you!\r
A-OK! Looks safe to me!\nNot a problem in sight!\n
I routinely check the lifts here.\nYou can be sure of their safety!\n
Hey! This is no playground!\nIf you're gonna play, battle me!\r
You played me like an amateur!\n
They were going to close this place\nup so no one could get in.\rBut, they left it open so people and\nPokémon can get together here.
The Canalave Gym folks use this place\nas their training grounds.\r
Maybe I should head to the Gym and\nwork out there...\n
Roark spent his childhood playing\nhere, I think...\n
Humph! You're lost, aren't you?\nI'll guide you if you can beat me.\r
You didn't really have to win!\nI'm not going to guide you now!\n
I'm not lost, I tell you!\nI'm camping! That's my story!\n
Huh? Are you lost too?\nNo? It doesn't matter.\fLet's have a quick Pokémon battle!\r
Lost?\nThere's nothing lost about this kid!\n
I got separated from my friends...\rI've got my Pokémon with me, so I'm\nOK, but...\n
You look like you might just have\nthe Pokémon I've been looking for!\r
You didn't have a single Pokémon\nI wanted... You're no Collector!\n
I'm very picky, so I want to collect\nevery Pokémon without anyone's help.\r...I do have friends, though.\nNo, seriously! I do!\n
In deep tunnels and caves, there're\na couple things you're sure to see.\rZUBAT and Ruin Maniacs!\r
Your awesome power...\nIt's mystifying.\n
I've scoured every inch of this\nplace... Most of it while I was lost.\rAnyway, if there's one thing I can\nsay, this place can't be called ruins!\n
Hush now, lost little Pokémon, don't\nyou cry.\rI'm here to take care of you!\r
Sniffle... W-who's crying now?\n
Speaking of crying, I'm positive I\nheard crying from deeper in the cave.\n
Look! A Trainer lost in Wayward Cave!\r
I strayed from the battle plan!\n
Me? No, I'm not lost.\nI live here!\n
Wandering around, I got hungry, so\nI ate some wild mushrooms...\rThey gave me gas, and now I can't\nstop burping! Bluurrf!\r
Bleff! Hurk!\nI think...I'm getting better...\n
I hear there's a Pokémon that has\nmushrooms growing on its back.\rNot around here, somewhere far away.\nI wonder if they taste any good?
Where am I? Am I lost? Who are you?\nAre you a Pokémon Trainer?\r
OK, so we're both Trainers.\nThat's a start, right?\n
I just wanted to have a picnic under\nthe Cycling Road.\rI didn't think I would get lost\nin a place like this...
What every good picnic needs is a\ncute setting, good food, and a fun\fbattle!\r
That wasn't any fun for me!\n
Why have a picnic here? I don't know.\nThere's no deep meaning to it.
Did you come to play, too?\nWanna play battle with me?\r
You were just toying with me!
I'm playing hide-and-seek here.\nI like some underground tag, too.\n
The sharp vision of my bird Pokémon\nwill see through your weaknesses!\r
Don't you have an Achilles' heel?
I want to become stronger, but only\nwith my favorite Pokémon.\n
Learning how to manage tough Pokémon\nis the shortcut to getting tough.\r
I lost? But how is that possible?!\n
Getting the best out of any Pokémon...\nThat's what makes a good Trainer...\n
When Trainers lock eyes...\rThat's right! It's time to let\ntheir Pokémon go wild!\r
Your Pokémon have a real peppy feel to\nthem!\n
Whether you're talking to people or\nPokémon, it's important to always look\fthem square in the eyes.\n
I want my Pokémon to get a taste of\nthe sweetness that is victory.\rI can't afford to lose this one!\r
This defeat has the tang of my bitter\ntears...
I'm sorry, my Pokémon team...\rI promise, I'll get better at this so\nyou can get a taste of victory!\n
I will win. I am sure of it.\nTherefore, you will lose!\r
But...\nThis isn't possible!\n
It's not that you've won.\nIt's just that I lost!\r...It's all the same.\nGo, me.\n
Let me see what you got there, kid.\nI could give you some advice.\r
You got way too much!\n
Well, I don't have any advice for\nsomeone as tough as you!\n
Now we shall battle, and from it will\nemerge one loser...\r
...!\n
I can use psychic powers, but\nbattling isn't so simple...\rIt takes much more to win!\n
A battle is a clash of willpower!\rThe one who wants the win the most\nwill emerge the victor!\r
But... I thought I could win!\n
Psychic power...\rI know it isn't easy to believe in\nsomething that you can't see.\rBut love, friendship...\nYou can't see those, either.\n
Allow me to demonstrate how a true\nPsychic conducts a battle!\r
Did I get to show you anything...?\nAnything at all?\n
What can psychic power be used for?\rWell, one mustn't use it for committing\ncrimes.\rBut, I don't use it for doing good,\neither.\rUsing psychic power leaves me too worn\nout!\n
I see it!\nI see a victory for me!\r
The future...is different!\nWhy?!\n
Your efforts have altered the very\npath of the future!\n
I trained all of my gnarly Pokémon\nat the Fighting Dojo in Kanto!\r
D  n     i\n  o  e     n...\n
We're gonna go ahead and leave...\nYou know, go train elsewhere.\n
Judo chop!\nPokémon battle!\r
Wrroar!\nJudo chop defeated!
I'll forget that we lost!\r...Wait, if I did that, we'd never\nlearn from our mistakes...\n
What it means to battle...\nIts joys, its sorrows...\fI've experienced it all!\r
My sorrow deepens...\n
You may be a child, but you've taught\nme a whole lot. I thank you humbly.\n
I'll wheel out some wicked Pokémon\nand even wickeder moves!\r
All I can manage now is to wheeze\nout a few meek sighs...\n
I don't see what my age has to do\nwith playing with Pokémon, frankly.\n
I let my bird Pokémon carry me to\nwherever. And so, here I am!\r
Sheesh... I arrive in a new place, and\nit turns out to be the Battle Zone...\n
I was born in the Hoenn region.\nI've only just recently flown here.\n
I let my bird Pokémon do as they\nwish. And so, we train here daily!\r
My Pokémon grew up in the arms of\nMother Nature. They're tough!\r
How could you be tougher than\nMother Nature?\n
Most of the time, my Pokémon return\nto their Poké Balls right away.\rBut sometimes, they just fall asleep\non top of my head. That gets messy.
The desire to win... That should be\nevident in every Trainer!\r
See the potential of dragon Pokémon!\nThe Championship is within my sights!\r
Potential doesn't mean I can win...\n
A Dragon Tamer Champion...\rI'll need to train so much more to\neven come close to coming close...\n
I've cranked up my dragon Pokémon's\npotential!\rI've been looking forward to seeing\nyou again!\r
My Pokémon and I seek only victory!\r
Arrrgh! My Pokémon...\n
I failed my Pokémon!\nI wasn't prepared enough to lead it!\rI don't ever want my precious Pokémon\nto be humiliated again!\n
You've beaten us once before, but we\nwon't make the same mistake!\r
Dragon Pokémon are sacred beings...\nThat's what my master taught me.\rAnd now I'll prove it to you!\r
Not good enough!\nWe're still not strong enough!\n
It's not good enough for a Pokémon\nto just be tough.\rIt's not good enough for a Trainer\nto just work hard.\rBoth have to grow together!
This time we'll get it right!\rMarvel at the exquisite combination of\nmy Pokémon and myself!\r
How do you do?\nI'm Stanley, and I'm a Dragon Tamer.\rWhat do you say we let our Pokémon\nhave it out? Sound OK to you?\r
Victory!\nThat is, victory for you...\n
It seems to me, there's this certain\nimage that goes with a Dragon Tamer.\rBut me, I'd much sooner take it easy,\ntake it slow, and take it my own way.\rI figure there's more than my style\nthat I need to work on first.\n
Hey, how do you do again?\rWhat do you say we let our Pokémon\nhave at it again? Sound OK to you?\r
There is something missing in the\nway I battle...\rI've come here to find it.\r
I see it now...\nI know what I lack.\n
Battling you was an eye-opener.\rI learned something very important\nin that short time.\n
Have you discovered what's missing in\nyour battles? I have.\r
I've got the urge to battle with you.\nHope you're willing to oblige!\r
I shouldn't have paid attention\nto my urge...\n
So long as my partner's alongside me,\nI'm willing to take on the world!\n
The urge to battle you again has\nstruck me. Want to humor me?\r
Have you any knowledge of levels\nor the stats of Pokémon? Well, I do!\r
Hmm. I like how you attack.\n
Pokémon and numbers...\nWho cares about that stuff?\rWinning is what's important.\nNumbers aren't everything.\n
Pokémon battles aren't decided by\nnumbers.\rIt's the bond you share with your\nPokémon that decides outcomes!\r
Welcome to my Pokémon show!\r
Did you enjoy the show?\nSuper fabulous, wasn't it?\n
I'll be happy to battle you again!\nLet's battle again sometime, yeah?
Welcome to my new Pokémon show!\r
I've pumped up my gang till they can't\nget pumped no more.\rThey're going to school your Pokémon!\r
My bunch got schooled, and how!\n
I fed my gang Protein, Carbos...\nYou name it, I pumped 'em full of it.\n
Hey! You're that Trainer who schooled\nme and my Pokémon!\rOK, this time we'll return the favor!\nWe'll be doing the schooling!\r
I took great pains raising my partners.\nI'll show you how strong I made them!\r
It needs to be leveled more?!\n
My Pokémon...\rThey're the first friends I ever\ncaught. They mean everything to me!
...When I close my eyes, I can picture\nhow we lost to you in vivid detail.\rBut, I've raised them since then! I'll\nthrow their strength in your face!\r
Worthy opponents... The search for\nthem drives me to travel far.\r
I've certainly found a tough\nadversary in you...\n
How much you believe in your\nPokémon...\rThat's a critical factor in how a\nbattle will turn out.\n
We've faced many challengers since\nwe met, but they were all weak...\rI relish the tough resistance that\nonly you can provide!\r
Please don't hold anything back.\r
Hmm...\n
I feel invigorated from that battle,\neven though we lost.\rAfter all, we gave it everything we\nhad.
Hello again! Please don't hold\nanything back--just like before.\r
You're willing to battle?\nLet me see what you have?\r
Your love of Pokémon really shows!\n
I grew up together with Felix and\nmy team, right from my childhood.\rAll our memories, we've always shared\nthem.\n
Oh, hi, we meet again.\rMay I see what you've done with your\nPokémon?\r
The world is huge, and there are\nso many different Pokémon!\rWhat kinds of Pokémon are with you?\nPlease, I want to have a look!\r
Wow, there are Pokémon that\nwonderful!\n
There is always something to like\nabout any Pokémon.\rIt's so hard to decide which ones\nI should raise.\n
If I'm having trouble deciding,\nI go with my favorites!\r
What sort of moves have you taught?\nThat tells me how good you are!\r
Yowch!\n
I heard that somewhere there's\nsomeone who teaches Pokémon moves.\n
Have you taught your team any new\nmoves since last time?\r
When eyes meet...\nThat's when a battle starts!\r
You won't let me win?\n
I suddenly remembered what it was \nlike when I had my first battle.\rI wonder why that would be?\n
When eyes meet...\nThat's when a battle starts!\fThat's what makes us Trainers!\r
You're going to win!\nThat's the future I saw!\r
What I saw in the future turned out\nto be true...\n
I lost, but my vision of the future\ncame true...\n
You're going to win again!\nThat's the future I saw!\r
Right after this, you will send out your\nPokémon to do battle!\r
After this, I will reluctantly hand over\nthe prize money to you...\n
What will you do after this?\rWhy don't you decide for yourself?\nIt would be much more fun that way!\n
Right after this, you will hurl a Poké\nBall in an astonishingly cool way!\r
My quest for power brought me here.\rIt was beneath the desert sand that\nI toughened my body and soul.\rAccept my challenge! Uraah!\r
My spirit is broken...\n
I thought I couldn't win before it\nbecame a fact...\rI've let down my Pokémon...\rThey go to battle with faith in\ntheir Trainer...
This time! This time I will win!\nMy spirit is renewed and strong!\r
I have meditated under a waterfall\nto temper my spirit.\rAllow me to demonstrate its strength!\r
Ha-choo! Sniffle...\n
All that time under the waterfall...\nSeems I've caught a cold.\n
Since the day I lost to you, I've\nmeditated under a waterfall!\r
People! Nature! Pokémon!\nHarmony is essential!\r
You're A-OK!\n
Protecting Pokémon and nature.\nThink of what that means.\n
Do you remember my slogan?\nPeople! Nature! Pokémon!\rThat's right, harmony is essential!\r
I work to protect beautiful, natural\nenvironments.\rMy Pokémon are my constant\ncompanions while I work.\r
Oh, my gosh!\nMy poor Pokémon!\n
Everyone can do their part to keep\nnature clean. It doesn't take much.\n
I'm on patrol in pristine nature\nwith my Pokémon like usual.\rCome to think of it, you're always\nwith Pokémon, too.\r
We go on patrol to make sure there's\nnothing strange going on.\rAnd occasionally, we battle!\r
Thanks much!\n
Using the Pokémon ability Pickup for\ngathering dropped items is a good thing.\rI think it's ecological, even.\nI am cleaning up the environment!\n
Patrols day in and day out!\nAnd the occasional battle!\r
In the embrace of Mother Nature,\npeople and Pokémon grow strong!\r
Your Pokémon are so muscular.\nIt makes me sigh seeing them...\n
It doesn't matter where they grow.\rPokémon can be made tougher\nanywhere if you set your mind to it.\n
By battling tough opponents, both\nTrainers and Pokémon grow tough!\r
We've grown strong together in\nnature and in the concrete jungle.\rWe make everywhere we go our\nplayground!\r
You're really tough, aren't you?!\n
Look around you at this wildly\ncontorted terrain.\rIt's no wonder that Pokémon would\ngrow tough in a place like this.\n
We're tough, but we know you're just\nas tough!\rLet's battle it out to see which one of\nus is tougher!\r
Are you getting worn out from all\nthe running you've done?\r
You're not tired at all?!\n
The world is full of Pokémon and all\nsorts of Trainers.\n
What do you think of the Battle\nZone?\rYou've met so many Pokémon...\nI've got to battle you again!\r
A Trainer riding a Pokémon!\nI like that! Let's battle it out!\r
Awesome!\nYou're a real wild child!\n
You ride atop the waves while riding on\na Pokémon!\rAnd you rode right over me!\n
Yo, Pokémon-riding Trainer!\nHow about a rematch?\r
Check out my physique! The rough\nseas sculpted this awesome body!\r
I've got a muscular physique, but\nthere's no strength behind it...\n
Seeing a Pokémon use Surf to carry you\nout on the sea...\rIt strikes an emotional chord with me\nsomewhere deep down.\n
The rough seas almost drowned...\n...I mean, sculpted this awesome body!\rLet my chiseled physique inspire you!\r
Check out my dynamic form!\nVictory is assured!\r
Oh.\nThat's how it is.\n
Being a good swimmer doesn't make\nme any better as a Trainer...\n
Hi! You're that kid who's great with\nPokémon!\rI'll battle with an even more dynamic\nform than before! Watch me now!\r
Me and my Pokémon are pumped up\nand ready to go all out!\r
Our muscles are deflating...\n
Overwhelm with our dazzling physiques!\nThat was our game plan...\n
Me and my Pokémon are pumped up!\nSee, our muscles are twitching!\r
People keep coming to us for battles.\nI really don't know why! Teehee!\r
OK, we lost.\n
I wanted to be alone, but swatting\naway immature boys on the prowl...\rWell, my Pokémon grew tough without\nme really even trying.\n
People still keep coming to us for\nbattles! Why?! Leave me alone!\r
Are your Pokémon growing properly?\r
Maybe too grown up!\n
I've grown with my Pokémon, too.\nMy swimsuit's getting a little tight...\n
Did your Pokémon grow any more?\rMy Pokémon?\nMine are doing awesome!\r
I'm a mermaid drifting among the\nwaves...\rAnd a high-spirited gal who battles with\nPokémon!\r
Losing...\nMakes my tears well up.\n
A mermaid's tears are so salty...\n
I'm still a mermaid drifting among the\nwaves...\rAnd a high-spirited gal who battles with\nPokémon!\r
I want to be with my water Pokémon!\nThat's why I swim!\r
Glub glub...\nI'm sinking...\n
I thought that everyone would be all\ndedicated to training out here.\rBut most people are really laid back.\nIt's not like what I imagined.\rI guess being with Pokémon, people get\nall mellowed out.\n
I want to be with water Pokémon!\nThat's why I'm going to get tougher!\r
                                                                 
                    
                                                         
With one mighty flap, my birds blow\naway the embers of aggression!\r
We failed to get off the ground...\n
The HM Fly isn't useful inside caves.\nIt's such a shame.\n
Dragons and a fiery mountain...\nIt's a totally classic setup!\r
Losing isn't a happy occasion...\n
My Pokémon seem to like it here\na lot.\n
Are you seeking the mythical\nPokémon, too? Let's battle, then!\r
There's nothing left...\n
The mythical Pokémon that sleeps\ndeep in a volcano...\rCould it be a dragon Pokémon?\n
What it means to win battles...\nThat is what I seek.\fTeach me if you will!\r
I grow less certain still...\n
Perhaps there is no meaning to\nvictory, but still I will battle!\rThat is what makes me a Trainer!\n
Let me ask to see if you know.\nWhat is time?\r
Another memory...\nIn a chain of memories.\n
For me, time is the fabric woven by\nmemories, one after another...\n
I was born in Floaroma Town.\nI'm sure thrilled to be here.\rIt took a long time to get here.\nWe're not going to lose again!\r
We went down...\nWe couldn't stick it out...\n
You can level all you want, but that\nwon't guarantee you any wins.\rBut we keep trying to get better.\nThat's what makes us Trainers.\n
The Trainers and Pokémon that gather\nhere aren't pushovers.\fThey all have tricks up their sleeves!\r
You're not a Trainer that can be\ntaken lightly!\n
The Pokémon you'll meet here won't\nmake it easy for you to move onward.\n
You've come all this way for Pokémon?\nYou must be dedicated.\r
Your dedication won out.\n
The Pokémon here must battle each\nother all the time.\rThat must be why they are so strong\nin this area.\n
Can you answer this for me?\nWhat is space?\r
And another...\nA new memory was born.\n
For me, space is where memories are\nmade...\n
I came here after winning my way\nthrough the Battle Tower!\r
But...\nI had a win streak going...\n
Train more at the Battle Tower...\nThat's what I'll do.\n
We're all good to go!\nWe just have to battle now!\r
Aww...\nI'm out of useful items!\n
We came completely unprepared for\nthis little adventure...\n
I had a revelation this morning.\rI knew that I would have a wonderful\nencounter here today.\r
There's nothing wonderful about this!\n
Is my sense of premonition nothing\nto write home about?\n
I'll use my mystifying psychic power\nto pulverize you!\r
That's what I get for making idle\nclaims...\n
Psychic power is a mystery that\ndefies explanation.\rBut if everything could be explained,\nit would be a boring world.
My Pokémon can destroy anything.\nAnd you think you can win?!\r
We weren't up to the task!\n
Even though my team could break\nbricks and shatter boulders, they\ffailed to dent your spirits!\n
Hear the howl of my iron fists!\nHowdy! I'm crazy for karate!\r
Losing made it clear to me.\nYou're crazy about Pokémon!\n
I love seeing people who love Pokémon\nmore than anything!\n
What do you expect to achieve here?\nI'll be the one to make that call!\r
You've earned the right to be here.\nBoth you and your Pokémon.\n
You may find it odd, but the stink\nof sulfur from the volcanic gas\fis what draws me here.\n
                                                                                     
     
                                                            
                                                                                     
     
                                                            
                                                                                      
     
                                                            
                                                                                      
     
                                                            
                                                  
                             
                                                          
                                                  
                             
                                   
                                                  
                             
                                                              
                                                  
                             
                                                     
                           
         
                                
                           
         
                                
                           
         
                                
                           
         
                                
                                                                                   
                              
                                                            
                                                                          
                              
                                                            
                                                                            
                              
                                                            
                                                                                     
                              
                                                            
                                                                                     
                              
                                                            
                                                                                   
                              
                                                            
                                                                                
                              
                                                            
I just got worked over!\nAnd by a kid no less...\n
...!\nAgain and again...\n
It is our mission to stall you.\nSorry, but we gotta do our job.\r
Losing was a part of my job, too.\n...I feel better by saying that.\n
From three lakes, we must secure three\nPokémon.\rYou simply mustn't interfere!\n
In order for us to bring peace to\nthe world, we must control it!\r
You're too young to understand.\n
Our boss always had plans for\nthe three lakes...\rWhile you were blissfully ignorant,\nour work went ahead...\n
I'll knock your Pokémon into orbit!\r
My mind is going orbital!\n
The Pokémon here has already been\ntaken to our HQ in Veilstone.\rSo, you see?\nA child like you can't touch us!\n
If this mission is successful, we\nwill get a nice bonus.\r
There goes our bonus...\nThis is an epic tragedy...\n
I want Team Galactic to become\npowerful. That is all I want.\n
...You, my friend, are tough!\nI can see why you defy us so...\n
We set off the Galactic Bomb!\nIts blast force was phenomenal!\r
Your Pokémon attack with phenomenal\npower...\n
But so what?\nYou aim to take us all on?\rDream on!\nTeam Galactic is huge in number.\rEven as we speak, other members should\nbe near Twinleaf Town.\rThat's right, they're on the way to\nLake Verity!\n
I'll punish you in place of our\nboss for defying Team Galactic!\r
Grr...\nI took the punishment...\n
We're Team Galactic!\nThe no. 1 syndicate in the world!\rTo defy us is to defy the universe!\n
...Would you like to join the MAGIKARP\nand flop around in the mud?\r
...Overwhelming!\n
I played you for a child, and paid\na stiff price for my arrogance...\rHowever, you're much too late.\rTeam Galactic has already found the\nsunken island under the lake.\rAnd the Pokémon that lay in it?\nWell, what do you think?\n
You're tough, kid!\nBut, I still pity the likes of you.\n
Well, what have we here?\nA Trainer who's lost their way?\r
You're lost but you won!\nThat burns me up to eleven!\n
You barged right into our HQ?\nYou must not know what fear is, kid!\n
What with that creepy Charon and a kid\nlike you around, the HQ's not the\fsame anymore.\rLike, you characters changed the,\nwell, character of the place!\r
Oh, sure. Why don't you just get\nall cocky about it!\n
Without our special card key, you're\nnot going to get very far.\rWell, non-Team Galactic member?\nWhat's your next move?\n
Who do you think you are?\nDesecrating the halls of our HQ?!\r
A tough little Trainer is what you\nare...\n
In our HQ, we get around by taking\nwarp panels.\rI'd like to see you figure out how\nthey connect.\n
You're too young to understand the\nchanging times!\rStand aside and let Team Galactic\nshape the future!\r
I failed to read the flow of battle, and\nyour power was unfathomable...\n
Come on, I said something cool before\nthe battle.\rYou need to read the dramatic situation\nbetter here!\n
I'm, like, this close to getting my\npromotion to Commander.\rI'll impress our great boss by making\nyou my newest trophy!\r
...I wish this never happened.
Losing sets me back to square one...\rI'll probably get busted down to the\ngruntiest of the grunts... Humph!
                           
                
                                
                            
                        
                                                        
Intruder alert!\nThere's something smelly about you!\r
Oh, it was my own Pokémon's smell...\n
How could we arouse suspicion?\nWe're Team Galactic, and this is our HQ!\n
Having fun scampering around our HQ,\nyou sneaky intruder?\rYour trail blazing will go out in\na blaze of glory right now!\r
Your trailblazing streak lives on!\n
So what, you have momentum...\nIt's too late. The experiment's done!\n
You should be tired out by now.\nIt's Team Galactic's turn to shine!\r
What? I don't get it.\nWhat's your rush?\n
Pokémon are that important to you?\nIs that what this is all about?\n
Are you enjoying your unescorted,\nunauthorized, and unsettling tour\fof Team Galactic HQ?\r
Let me do what I want!\n
It doesn't matter what happens to\nthe Team Galactic HQ building.\rSoon, all will belong to Team\nGalactic, anyway!\n
Hey there, little Trainer!\nYou're famous among Team Galactic.\rThe order has been issued--we get\na promotion if we put you down!\r
I just blew my promotion...\n
What's so special about you anyway?\rYou're just like any other little kid\nTrainer you can find anywhere!
Our time has come!\nIt's Team Galactic's time now!\r
When's it gonna be my turn...\n
It's too late!\rNo amount of desperation from a kid\nlike you will make a difference!\n
Our time is coming!\nA time for us alone!\rWe'll send you back in time.\nA time before you started training!\r
Gyah!\n
You can struggle all you want, but\nyou can't stop Team Galactic alone!\rIt doesn't matter how many Pokémon\nyou try to use as your tools!\n
Team Galactic is all powerful!\rOnly a fool would show defiance to\nthe mighty might of Team Galactic!\r
Not standing up to the mighty is\nfoolish, you say...\n
It doesn't matter if you're an adult\nor a kid if you have Pokémon...\rPokémon are the equalizers.\nI should have realized sooner...
I can't believe you chased me here...\nOK, let's see how tough you are.\r
Where do you get that power?!\n
Mt. Coronet...\rI might be just a grunt, but even I\ncan tell it has a weird energy!\n
This is our final operation.\nNo one will interfere!\r
You turned the tables on me...\nI call interference...\n
The closer you are to the peak,\nthe closer you are to space!\rSoon, Team Galactic will... Uh...\nTeam Galactic will achieve greatness!\n
Team Galactic will take control of\neverything!\rYou can try all you want, but you\ncan't do anything alone!\r
All you gave me was the taste of\ndefeat...\n
...Is our boss about to ditch us\nand claim everything for himself?
We Grunts have two jobs.\rOne, ensure the success of our\noperation at the summit.\rTwo, utterly destroy any intruders\nto stop their meddling!\r
I don't accept this!\nI will not accept this!\n
Join Team Galactic and then abide\nby our rules.\rThat would solve all our problems!\n
Say, listen, do you realize you're\nbreaking hearts by being successful?\rIt's your fault that Team Galactic\nmembers are in so much pain...\r
See? You've left me brokenhearted,\ntoo...\n
Someone's joy is another person's\nsorrow...\rEveryone be happy and laughing?\nHow ridiculous!\rTeam Galactic should be doing all the\nlaughing!\n
...Our boss is going to do something\nhuge at the summit.\rBut here I am dealing with some pesky\nintruder.\rYou're spoiling the atmosphere.\nYou can lose quickly, right?\r
You're not supposed to work me\nover like that.\n
All my excitement's gone now...\rThis whole Mt. Coronet trip is too\nrough, long, and draining...\n
You've worked so hard to get here.\nYou should be proud of yourself!\rAnd now, I'll send you packing home\nwith only that happy thought!\r
Wh-- How dare you! That's how you\nrespond to my generosity?\n
We couldn't stop you...\nWe'll be discarded as useless...\rOur boss is ruthless that way...\n
Oh, yeah?\nI'll show you something wicked, too!\n
What the?! We're in trouble?!\nBut there's no giving up on me!\n
What just happened?!\nYou're telling me I lost?!\n

It's not over yet!\nA League Elite Four cannot give up!\n
I will now concede defeat.\rBut I think you came to see how\ngreat Bug-type Pokémon can be.\rI hope you also realized what you're\nup against in the Pokémon League.\rBattling is a deep and complex\naffair...\n
Dear child, don't assume for an\ninstant that you've won.\n
Well! Dear child, I must say, that\nwas most impressive.\rYour Pokémon believed in you and did\ntheir best to earn you the win.\rEven though I've lost, I find myself\nwith this silly grin!\n
I can feel your determination.\nYour will is overpowering me!\n
This situation...\nThis is heating up! I'm blazing now!\n
...!\rI don't believe it! I lost!\nI didn't take you for granted...\rBut I didn't expect you to win!\nI'd never even considered it!\rI'm blown away by this!\nYou and your Pokémon are hot stuff!\n
Hmm...\nNow what should I do...\n
I see...\rYou getting past the three before\nme was no fluke. Your power is real.\n
I can't remember the last time I\nwas put in a corner like this!\n
I won't let this end yet! This match\nis too fun to let it end this easily!\n
...Just a few minutes ago, you were\nthe most powerful challenger.\rAnd just now, you became the most\npowerful of all the Trainers.\rYou are now our newest Champion!\n
You got Pokémon! I got Pokémon!\nLet's see whose Pokémon is the best!\r
I give up! You're too much!\nAre you maybe a Pokémon genius?\n
Making Pokémon battle each other\nmakes them tougher, you know?\n
Hi, what kinds of Pokémon do you\nhave with you?\rI'll show you my Pokémon while we\nhave a battle.\r
Huh? It's over already?!\nI thought I'd win for sure!\n
You're too tough!\nI won't battle you again!\rJust joking! I'll challenge you again\nwhen I level up my Pokémon.\n
You're a Pokémon Trainer, and so\nam I.\rWhen Trainers lock eyes, that means\na battle is on!\r
Losing makes me mad, but that\nwas still a bunch of fun!
With Pokémon that tough, I bet you\ncould go anywhere in Sinnoh!\n

Rock 'n' roll!\nWe'll beat it out again!\fOur rhythm of battle!\r
Can you hear it?\nThat's my guitar weeping...\n
Last time, you beat me before I had\na chance to show you my skill.\rThis time, I'll shows you why they\nconsider me an ace!\r
I'm burning with jealousy over your\ntalent!\n
Ace Trainers always work to improve\ntheir natural-born talents.\r
I see...\nI have to concede defeat.\n
Pal Park, huh? I wonder what kinds\nof Pokémon you can see there?\r
You're one enthusiastic Trainer.\n
Hi, traveler!\rI've forgotten your name, but we've\nbattled before, haven't we?\r
You sure showed me up.\n
Oh, we'll ride upon the sea,\nin a boat, just you and me!\rThat's the way of the Sailor!\nWay of the Sailor. You sing, too!\r

I've been training here in hopes of\ngoing to the Pokémon League.\r
I'm shocked...\nNo, really.\n
I've decided! If I finally beat you,\nI'm challenging the Pokémon League!\r
Blblblblugh...\n
It's me again! The harsh sea here\nshould have toughened me up!\r
The world remains as harsh as\never...\n
It doesn't matter how long it takes,\nI'm going to the Pokémon League!\r
Th-this is so hard...\n
How much stronger did your Pokémon\nbecome?\rLet me check for you, OK?\r
I've had my fill...\n
My dragon Pokémon chose to remain\nhere to become powerful.\r
Your battle style...\n
Why have you come back to this spot?\nI want to know what all this means!\r
I see...\rSo that's what it was...\n
See?\nYou've come back again.\rThere must be something that draws\nyou here...\r
The power that slumbers within you...\nIt is rather marvelous...\n
I am indeed a Veteran, but I don't\nuse that as an excuse to slack off.\rI take pride in challenging those\nwho have bested me before!\r
I see...\nSimply outstanding.
I let my bird Pokémon do as they\nwish. And so, we train here daily!\r
Sheesh... I arrive in a new place and\nit turns out to be the Battle Zone...\n
I've cranked up my dragon Pokémon's\nabilities!\rI've been looking forward to seeing\nyou again!\r
Raising abilities alone doesn't mean\nI can win either...\n
What's missing from my game...\nHave you discovered yours yet?\r
I see it now...\n
The urge to battle you again has\nstruck me. Humor me!\r
I shouldn't have paid attention\nto my urge...\n
We've faced many challengers since\nwe met, but they were all weak...\rI relish the tough resistance that\nonly you can provide!\r
I've found a tough adversary in\nyou...\n
Hello again! Please don't hold\nanything back, just like before.\r
Hmm...\n
You're going to win again!\nThat's the future I saw!\r
What I saw in the future turned out\nto be true...\n
Right after this, you will hurl a Poké\nBall in an astonishingly cool manner!\r
Right after this, I have to pay\nout your prize money...\n
This time! This time I will win!\nMy spirit is renewed and strong!\r
My spirit is broken...\n
Do you remember my slogan?\nPeople! Nature! Pokémon!\rThat's right. Harmony is essential!\r
You're A-OK!\n
By battling tough opponents, both\npeople and Pokémon grow tough!\r
My, you are tough.\n
Yo, Pokémon-riding Trainer!\nHow about a rematch?\r
Awesome!\nYou're a real wild child!\n
People still keep coming to us for\nbattles! Why?!\r
OK, we lost.\n
                                                    
                                 
Does this mean I'm only talented as\nan Artist?\n
You're a lucky one...\n
I never thought I'd lose at\nPapa's restaurant...\n
Ohh... How could I lose at dear\nPapa's restaurant?\n
Ack! I lost...\nCheck, please!\n\n
So young, and yet so strong!\nHow very remarkable!
I don't care if I lose.\nI'm still a happy guy.\n
Waaah! You're too much!\n
Wow... You're out there.\n
No one's hurt?\n
Tough, aren't you...?\n
I was with my daddy, too...\n
That's quite the demonstration.\n
Hmm...\nI should have expected this.
My luck's run out...\n
I think I have what it takes to\nbecome a successful model!\n
Hmm... I failed to foresee this\noutcome...\n
You know, I had confidence before\nheading into this.\n
Yeah, like I'm really supposed to\nwin with a Pokémon like this...
We spend all our time battling in the\nblizzards of Snowpoint City.\rWe'll show you how it's toughened\nus up!\r
What's with your toughness?!\n
You've battled all over, you say?\nThat makes you tough, perhaps.\n
I've only been involved with Pokémon\nfor a short time.\rI managed to get this far because\nskilled friends toughened me up!\r
I can't believe how tough you are!\n
If you have wonderful friends, there\nis no limit to how far you can go.\n
Our mission is to implement our\noperations without question.\rIt is all for the new world order\nthat our boss will lead!\r
This won't go unpunished...\n
I'm willing to do anything to get ahead\nin Team Galactic.\rOne day you'll see what we are all\nabout.\rIt's wonder, compassion, splendor,\nhumor, power, awe, and tragedy!\n
I won't let you disrupt our research!\nThis is for Team Galactic!\r
I got whipped...\nI look pathetic...\n
Our boss is a scientific genius!\rHe will make the power of mythical\nPokémon his own!\n
Hey, now! Our HQ is a state-of-the-\nart facility!\rA snot-nosed kid like you ought to\nkeep your dirty hands to yourself!\r
You and your Pokémon weren't part\nof my calculations...\n
Our boss is trying to create an\nentirely new world.\rA world only for us!\nFor Team Galactic!\n
Bika bikabika!\nPigachu!\r
Pikachu...\n
Pika...\rI'll need a lot more practice to\nbecome a real PIKACHU...\n
I work in the fiery foundry.\nYou bet I'm hot and sweaty!\r
I burned out...\n
I toughened up my muscles from\nhonest work.\rPokémon have nothing on me!\n
Well! It's not often we get a visitor\nlike you to the ironworks!\rLet's mark the occasion with\na battle!\r
Fire! And once more, only because I\nfeel like it, fiyaaaah!\n
The floor panels move automatically.\nWe're pretty proud of them here!\n
Are you maybe getting annoyed by\nwhere the floor panels take you?\r
I'm going down in flames!\n
The sweat of a working man is\nbeautiful to behold...\rThere is also beauty in the tears\nwept from defeat...\n
The toughest of all the grunts!\nThat was me...\n
Arrgh!\nI let some little kid beat me!\n
Sheesh... I should have done the\nfighting myself.\n
Humph! You've toughened up.\nBut you're no match for our boss.\n
Done in by two kids?!\nThis isn't right!\n
I should have kept my head down and\njust watched our warehouse...\n
Fweh... If I didn't run...\nI could've...battled harder...\n
My last Pokémon.\n
I see... I may lose if this pace\ncontinues...\n
Interesting.\nAnd quite curious.\n
I admit that you have pushed me\nto this extreme.\n
This... This cannot be!\nIt's not possible that I lose!\n
I won't accept this!\nThis can't be!\rNot after all the sacrifices we've made\nto get this far!\rWhat of my new world?!\nOf my new galaxy?!\rWas this all a dream to be swept away\nby your reality?!\n
I want to cry...\nMy heart is shattered...\n
They're too tough to handle!\nWhat a combination!\n
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough,\nmy Pokémon get tougher!\n
What just went down?!\nYou're telling me I lost again?!\n
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough,\nmy Pokémon get tougher!\n
What just went down?!\nYou're telling me I lost again?!\n

My pace is completely off...\n

No way! Not yet!\nNot giving up!\n
W-what? That can't be!\nMy buffed-up Pokémon!\n
Are you saying something?\nYou think you have me cornered?\n
Amazing!\nYou're very good, aren't you?\n
If we turn it around here, the\nspectators will be stoked!\n
That puts a grin on my face!\nGuhahaha! That was a blast!\n
This is like back at the Gym, isn't it?\nI'm in a bit of a bind, aren't I?\n
I'm forced to admit defeat again...\nYou are much too strong.\n
It is too difficult, but...\nNever give up, never surrender!\n
You are so fantastically strong.\nI know why I have lost.\n
Not yet!\nYou can't break our will!\n
You're mighty!\nYou're worthy of lots of respect.\n
We're not done yet!\nThere's no giving up!\n
Hmm!\nMy sturdy Pokémon--defeated!\n
You methodically corner me!\nJust like before!\n
I even felt thrilled during our\nmatch.\rThat was a very good battle.\n
I can't keep up with healing...\n
Striking the right balance of offense\nand defense... It's not easy to do.\n
Your team!\nI sense your strong aura!\n
At times we battle, and sometimes we\nteam up...\rIt's great how Trainers can interact.\n
...My time with you is drawing to a\nclose...\n
...Awww.\n
Now this!\nThis is a smoking-hot situation!\n
Heeheehee!\nSo hot, you!\n
Oh, no!\nYou're too much for me!\n
Mira wonders if she can get very far in\nthe Battle Tower.\n
What's with you?!\nDo you have a vendetta against me?!\n
Humph! Quit flaunting your toughness!\nIt's not cute in the least!\n
Oh, dear... The trouble with fun is that\nit is over so quickly.\n
Wow!\nYou're out of this world!\n
You are good, you!\nMy Pokémon, they have enjoyed it, too!\n
My Pokémon can't be faulted with\nanything.\rYour brilliance carried the day.\n
It's not over yet!\nA League Elite Four can't give up!\n
I will now concede defeat.\rBut I think you came to see how\ngreat Bug-type Pokémon can be.\rI hope you also realized what you're\nup against in the Pokémon League.\rBattling is a deep and complex\naffair...\n
Dear child, don't assume for an\ninstant that you've won.\n
Well! Dear child, I must say, that\nwas most impressive.\rYour Pokémon believed in you and did\ntheir best to earn you the win.\rEven though I've lost, I find myself\nwith this silly grin!\n
I can feel your determination.\nYour will is overpowering me!\n
This situation...\nThis is heating up! I'm blazing now!\n
...!\rI don't believe it! I lost!\nI didn't take you for granted...\rBut I never expected you to win!\nI'd never even considered it!\rI'm blown away by this!\nYou and your Pokémon are hot stuff!\n
Hmm...\nNow what should I do...\n
I see...\rYour getting past the three before\nme was no fluke. Your power is real.\n
I can't remember the last time I\nwas put in a corner like this!\n
I won't let this end yet! This match\nis too fun to let it end this easily!\n
...Just a few minutes ago, you were\nthe most powerful challenger.\rAnd just now, you became the most\npowerful of all the Trainers.\rYou are now our newest Champion!\n
No way! I won't give up!\nThere's never any giving up!
What was that about?!\rI'm going to get tougher, though!\nTougher with these guys!\n
