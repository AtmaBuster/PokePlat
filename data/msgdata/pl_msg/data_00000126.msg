Hiya!\nOh, you're a Trainer!\rThat means you're using Pokémon Boxes!\nI love meeting end users!\rOh, what's up?\nWhy that astonished look?\rOh, right, sorry!\nThere I go running my mouth again!\rMy name's Bebe!\rYou know the PC Pokémon Boxes?\nI'm the system administrator!\rI know this is out of the blue, but do\nyou want a Pokémon named EEVEE?
Bebe: So, how about it?\nDo you want that Pokémon EEVEE?
Bebe: Here you go!\rThat EEVEE, I got it from a good friend\nin Johto who has a whole lot of them.\rWho knows how many EEVEE he's raised\nover the years.\rSorry, that doesn't mean anything to\nyou.\rPlease, be good to it!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000 accepted the EEVEE!\r
Would you like to give a nickname\nto the EEVEE that Bebe gave you?
Bebe: Here you go!\rWait, I can't do that! You can't take\nany more Pokémon with you!\rRight about now, my Pokémon Boxes\ncome in handy!
Bebe: Oh, OK...\nGuess I'll have to raise it myself.
Bebe: My buddy Bill developed the\nbasic Pokémon Box storage system.\rI tinkered with it here and there to\nmake it easier to use.
Bebe: Oh? Now that's a National Pokédex\nI'm seeing. Good for you!\rYou'll be using my Pokémon Boxes a\nwhole lot more if you've got that.\rWell, I always thought a good Trainer\nought to juggle Boxes smartly, though.\fI shouldn't be the one to say so.
