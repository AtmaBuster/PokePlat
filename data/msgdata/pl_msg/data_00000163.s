I've heard about Victory Road, which\nleads to the Pokémon League.\rThe word is the road is harsh and\nharrowing.\rI'd better load up on as many items\nand as much medicine as I can carry...
I shall buy Seals for decorating Poké\nBalls at the Sunyshore Market.\rUsing those Seals in a cool way will be\nsure to impress my Pokémon!
