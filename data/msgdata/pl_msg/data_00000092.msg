Looker: Hello! It is me! Me!\nHahaha! I have startled you, yes?\rI am, after all, an officer of the\nInternational Police.\rIt is only natural that I be a master of\ndisguise.\r
...Incidentally, you are a first-rate\nTrainer. Of that, I am very aware.\rI therefore think you will be OK, but\nI must warn you to be careful anyway.\rAlso, a word of advice.\rThis building, it has two stairs.\nOne of them, a trap it must be.\rBut the crooks of Team Galactic, they\ndo not appear, how shall I say, smart.\rThere should be an easy way to tell\nthe stairs apart!\r
Looker: Now, I have been conducting\nmy investigation into Team Galactic.\rBut I have no clue as to who they are\nor what it is they wish to do.\rThe minions, they appear ignorant of\nthe intentions of their boss.\rAlso, a word of advice.\rThis building, it has two stairs.\nOne of them, a trap it must be.\rBut the crooks of Team Galactic, they\ndo not appear, how shall I say, smart.\rThere should be an easy way to tell\nthe stairs apart!
