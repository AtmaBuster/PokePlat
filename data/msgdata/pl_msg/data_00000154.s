Prof. Rowan: Hmm... Rage Candy Bars\nare too popular, it seems.\r
Ah, \v0103\x0000\x0000, it's you.\rDoes life continue to thrill you?\nIt does for me.\rFor example, I recently discovered\nsome Pokémon evolve only in certain\flocations.\rWhen I learned that, I felt thrilled!
I didn't expect to find paradise in the\ndepartment store's basement.\rI got carried away and bought up all\nthe Rage Candy Bars!
I'm hopeless at cooking Poffins, so I\nbuy them here.\rI wish I could feed my babies Poffins\nthat I made myself, though.
Pay attention, please.\rThe flavors of Poffins affect the\ncondition of Pokémon.\rSpicy Poffins enhance coolness.\rDry Poffins enhance beauty.\rSweet Poffins enhance cuteness.\rBitter Poffins enhance smartness.\rAnd Sour Poffins enhance toughness.\rSigh...\nPoffins are wonderful, aren't they?
Welcome to the basement--the food and\nproduce section.\rWe offer a fine and pleasing selection\nof Pokémon food and treats.
Have you ever planted Berries, then\npromptly forgotten about them?\rIf that's you, we have Berries on sale,\ntoo.
Hello!\nRage Candy Bars...\rI'm all sold out.\nI'm terribly sorry.
