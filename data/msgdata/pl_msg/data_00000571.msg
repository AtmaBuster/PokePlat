If you've got Pokémon with you,\nit's safe for even a kid like you\fto go off traveling alone.
I had a battle the other day, and my\nPokémon's HP got low.\rI thought we were done for.\rAnd then, all of a sudden, my Pokémon\nate the Berry it was holding! Whew!
There've been problems with the\nelectric power lately.\rIs there some trouble at the Valley\nWindworks?
It's a long way from here to Eterna\nCity.\rYou should be prepared for a long\njourney.
Po-Po-Pokémon!\rI want to become more like a PIKACHU!\nWill you battle me?
Pi-Pikachu!\r
Pi-Pikachu!
I can make static electricity, but I'm\nnot very much like a Pokémon yet.\rDon't give up, me!\nBecome a Pokémon, me!
