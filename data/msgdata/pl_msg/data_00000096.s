There is a mysterious notebook here.\nIts age is impossible to tell.\r“It was by pure chance that I obtained\ninformation about the Pokémon ROTOM.\r“Remarkably, ROTOM has the ability to\nenter and merge with special motors.\r“It's now known that ROTOM can stay\ninside a motor almost indefinitely.\r“However, it will emerge if it enters a\nUnion Room or a Wi-Fi Club.\r“ROTOM will also emerge from the motor\nif it is left at the Day Care.\r“ROTOM may also forget certain moves\nwhen it leaves a motor.\r“This Pokémon requires exhaustive\nobservation and analysis.\r“To ensure I get all the credit, my\nROTOM research must be kept secret.\r“They will come to recognize me as the\nscientific genius Char...”\rThe rest of the notebook is blank.
Rowan: Ah, imagine finding you here!\rYou must be eager to fill your Pokédex\nto be searching even here.\rWhat am I doing?\rI visit a professor I know in Eterna\nevery so often.\rHe tells me intriguing rumors of rare\nPokémon sightings and such.\r
A Pokémon that slips into electric\nappliances, you say...\rHmm...\rThat is somewhat off from what I've\nheard about it.\rHmm...\nThis is what I've heard.\rLong ago, there was a Pokémon that\nmerged with a toy robot.\rShould that Pokémon be recognized as a\nnew species or not...\rDebates over the issue were about to\nstart when they were rendered moot.\rThe very topic of discussion--the\nPokémon-infused robot--disappeared...\r
Anyway, this ROTOM...\nWhat an interesting Pokémon.\rSo, you say it enters an appliance and\nessentially merges with the device.\rIn the process, it may also learn new\nmoves.\rIn a way, I suppose it could be thought\nof as a mechanical Pokémon.\rHmm...!\rThough it is utterly unique, it is\nundeniably a form of Pokémon.\rFine, fine, so be it!\rNo matter how old one gets, there will\nalways be new Pokémon discoveries!\rTake care, \v0103\x0000\x0000!\r
It's an old notebook.\nThere's no telling how old it is.\rWould you like to read it?
“Our encounter was a sudden one.\r“It was when I found my toy robot,\none that I had earlier misplaced.\r“At that instant, a Pokémon startlingly\nemerged from the lawn mower's motor!\r“Clutching my robot, I stared,\ntransfixed by the peculiar Pokémon.”\r...Would you like to keep reading?
“The Pokémon hovered in the air, held\naloft by a power unseen.\r“As if curious and unafraid of my\npresence, it floated toward me.\r“Crackling sounds accompanied it, as \nif from static electricity in the air.\r“Remarkably, it seemed the Pokémon\nwas the source of this power!\r“In alarm, I flinched, certain that my\nface would be subjected to a shock.\r“Much to my surprise, the Pokémon\nseemed to favor me with a smile.”\r...Would you like to keep reading?
“Finally, I came to realize that the\nPokémon only wished to be friends.\r“I have decided to name this most\nwondrous Pokémon 'ROTOM.'\r“Simple though it may be, ROTOM emerged\nto me from the motor of a lawn mower.\r“Motor and ROTOM...\nSurely the link is obvious?”\r...Would you like to keep reading?
“ROTOM is a Pokémon that is simply\nsensational.\r“The fact that it can turn invisible is\nsimply the beginning.\r“What makes ROTOM unique is its ability\nto enter and operate machinery!”\r...This is about halfway through.\nWould you like to keep reading?
“ROTOM and I became fast friends.\nWe were perpetual companions.\r“The electricity from its body forbade\ncontact, however.\r“We could not touch, let alone hug or\nhold hands, but we cared not.\r“For we were bonded on a much deeper,\nincorporeal level.”\r...Would you like to keep reading?
“A feeling of mischief got the better\nof me one day.\r“Seeing ROTOM hovering, I decided to\nstartle it--normally I would not.\r“Perhaps frightened, ROTOM discharged\npower beyond its usual range.\r“I fell, stunned, into the arms of\nunconsciousness...”\r...Would you like to keep reading?
“When I came to, to my horror I\nrealized that ROTOM had disappeared.\r“I searched high and low for my friend\nin dismay and desperation.\r“'Don't chastise yourself.'\r“'The fault is mine. No harm done.'\r“'Let us play as we always have.'\r“Though my words poured out, my friend\ncould not be found to hear them...”\r...Would you like to keep reading?
“My search for ROTOM carried me far\nfrom home.\r“It was in the town's rubbish heap that\nI again found my old toy robot.\r“Curiously, our eyes met, then the\nrobot waved a hand as if in greeting.\r“I knew then that I had found my lost\nfriend.\r“I ran to it and hugged ROTOM tight,\ntalking on and on.”\r...Would you like to keep reading?
“The robot's eyes lit up happily as\nI held it.\r“I'm certain that, within it, ROTOM was \nemitting lots of electricity.\r“Somehow, I felt I could understand\nROTOM's thoughts better than before.\r“Also, I realized that we would remain\nfriends throughout our lives...”\r...The notebook ends with this page...
