Don't you dare go into the Valley\nWindworks.\rI got ordered to keep everyone out\nif they're not part of Team Galactic.\rYou're giving me a look that makes\nme think you're gonna try to get in.\rOK, then.\nYou'll have to battle me for it!\r
Isn't that just great.\nGetting owned by some kid.\rBut you can't do a thing if I lock\nmyself in with my Works Key!\rThat's right, the other Works Key's\nnot here!\rMy cohorts in the flower patch have\nthe only other one!\rHahaha! In that sense, I'm no longer\nthe loser!\r
Looker: Ah, yes.\nIt is you, yes.\rI have heard that the Team Galactic\nappeared at this power plant.\rI have, therefore, come running.\nSo, the Team Galactic. Where are they?\r...\rYou have run them off, you say?\nYou are a Trainer, but...?\rVery well!\nI shall go investigate inside!\r
Looker: Magnificent! Yes, it is!\nWhat you have said, it is all true!\rSuperb! Though you are young, you are\na Trainer through and through!\rVery well!\nI shall pursue the culprits!\rI have received tips that the Team\nGalactic hideout is in Eterna City.\rTo there, I must be off!\r
Ker-chunk!\r
It's locked from inside!
It's locked from inside!\rUse the Works Key?
Ker-chunk!\rThe door to Valley Windworks opened!
