You're a Trainer, aren't you?\rYou see, there's this Pokémon I'd like\nsomeone to look after.\rIt's a Pokémon called PORYGON.\nI found it near Team Galactic's building.\rI'm no Trainer, so can you take it off\nmy hands?

Excellent! Thanks!\nThat'll make the PORYGON happy, too.\rI suspect it ran away from those Team\nGalactic goons.\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000 accepted the PORYGON!\r
Would you like to give a nickname\nto the PORYGON you received?
Thanks!\r...But, oops, you already have a whole\nteam of Pokémon with you.\rIf you want this PORYGON, you'd better\nput one in a PC Box first.
Is that so...\rI'll look after it for a while. Please\ncome see me if you change your mind.
Team Galactic's building bugs me so\nmuch, I can't sleep well.\rIt's so bizarre, like a robot that's\nabout to start moving.
Those thorny things on the building...\nThe way it moves meaninglessly...\rI don't understand their idea of \n“awesomely fashionable” at all.\rStill, Team Galactic does seem to have\na huge supply of energy.
