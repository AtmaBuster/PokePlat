Buck: Yo, if it isn't \v0103\x0000\x0000!\nOut training right away, are you?\rSo, uh, since you're training anyway,\ncan you do me a favor?\rI'd like you to patrol Stark Mountain\nfor me.
Buck: Up past here, there's this\nvolcano. It's Stark Mountain.\rDeep inside it is this special rock called\nthe Magma Stone.\rI can't explain it well, but it's really\nimportant. It keeps a Pokémon asleep.\rBut lately, I've been hearing rumors\nabout vandals in Stark Mountain.\rThey say goons in space suits are\ncausing trouble there.\r
Huh?\nWhat, me?\rI was on my way to the Pokémon Center\nbecause my Pokémon's low on HP.\rSo, if you could get up to Stark\nMountain now, that'd be great. Thanks!\r
I'll keep asking the same thing over and\nover until you say “Yes!”\r
Buck: OK! You're in charge!\nPatrol Stark Mountain for me!\rDon't worry about me.\nNot even a little bit, OK?
Wake: Oh, if it isn't \v0103\x0000\x0000!\nIt's been a while!\rYou've grown so tough that you're\ntraining out here now...\rEveryone keeps getting tougher and\ntougher...\rAnd, in doing that, they develop\ncloser bonds with their Pokémon...\r
\v0103\x0001\x0000: That's my master!\nThose are words of wisdom!\r
Wake: What? Are you still having trouble\nunderstanding?\rI don't for a second ever recall\naccepting you as an apprentice!\rI mean, if it's wrestling moves, I can\nshow you all you like, but...\r
\v0103\x0001\x0000: Awww, master, don't be\nthat way!\rYou've got to get me into that club\nin the Survival Area!\r
Wake: ...How'd I get involved in this...?\rSo, anyway, \v0103\x0000\x0000.\nYou're going to Stark Mountain?\rEven the wild Pokémon there are very,\nvery tough...\rIf your Pokémon aren't well trained,\nthey'll have a miserable time...\rThen again, that kind of challenge\nis an exciting prospect...\rBut no matter what, you'd better\nbe fully prepared!\rI've got to get ready for another\ntournament. Farewell!\r
\v0103\x0001\x0000: You know, I think I got\na little tougher again.\rThat's why I'm off to the Battle\nFrontier so I can make some challenges!\r
Master!\nWait for me!\r
