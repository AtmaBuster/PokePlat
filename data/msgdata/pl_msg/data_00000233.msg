There's no way of getting to the\npeak of Mt. Coronet from this side!\rUh-oh... Was I supposed to go up from\nthe Oreburgh City side?\rMaybe I wasn't supposed to climb from\nthe Eterna City side?\rOh, didn't I need hidden moves like\nSurf, too?
Grunt 1: The fog is so thick ahead\nI can't even see my own hand!\rCan you use Defog so we can see?\r
Grunt 2: Hah? The Pok√©mon they gave me\ncan't use Defog, either.\rI think we're stuck.\nLet's wait till the others get here.\r
