...Pant...pant...\r...Why am I running like this anyway?!\rThat new world...\nThe new universe that our boss was\ftalking about...\rIt's making me giddy thinking about it...\nWhen we use this thing...\r
Gweh! You were eavesdropping!\nI was only talking to myself!\rYou're persistent, too...\nI'm pooped out from all the running...\rBut, I'm not...\nGoing to battle you...\r
Aww, no...\nYou're still on my tail...?\fThe lake's within sight...\rYou leave me no choice...\nMy Pokémon will KO you...\r
I can't battle anymore...\nI'm running on fumes...\rI'll have to give this to the\nCommander...\rI wish...\nI got to use it at the lake...\r
Cynthia: Oh, hello, long time no see!\nHow is your Pokédex filling up?\rI came to research the folklore\nabout the lake, but...\rWell, it doesn't appear as if the\nlake is open to the public now.\rHave you heard the folklore about it?\rThey say there is an island inside\nthe lake.\rAnd inside that island is a mirage\nof a Pokémon.\rNo one must enter the chamber\nof that Pokémon...\rOh, that's right! I had to talk to you\nabout something else...\r
\v0103\x0001\x0000: Hey, \v0103\x0000\x0000!\nWhere'd that Galactic goon run off to?\r
Huh?\nIs this your older sister?\rNo? She isn't?\nOh, OK.\r
That explosion in the Great Marsh?\nIt wasn't anything serious.\rMr. Wake told me to tell you that.\rBut that Team Galactic... Wow! Are they\nout of control or what?\rNext time I see them, I'll teach them\na lesson they won't forget!\rSee you around!\r
Cynthia: He's your friend?\rHe's more impatient than he is\nenergetic, isn't he?\r
Cynthia: So, getting back to what I\nstarted saying earlier...\rHave you seen the group of PSYDUCK\non Route 210?
Cynthia: Yes, that's right.\nBy the café on Route 210.\rYou've seen that group of PSYDUCK\nhuddled with their heads in their,\fuh, hands...?\r
Cynthia: You haven't seen them?\nBy the café on Route 210.\rThere's a group of PSYDUCK huddled\nwith their heads in their, uh,\fhands...?\r
Anyway, what you should do is use\nthis medicine on the PSYDUCK.\rYou're working on a Pokédex, so it\nwould be worthwhile for you.\r
Cynthia: I went on a big adventure\nwith a Pokédex when I was younger.\rI hope you get to meet every kind\nof Pokémon there is to see.\rIt may help you with the secret of\nthe mirage Pokémon.\rSee you later!\r
They say there's a legendary Pokémon\nin this lake.\rI aim to capture it on film like I've\ndone before.\rIt was me who filmed that red GYARADOS\nat Lake of Rage.
The Pokémon of the lake won't come out\nif it senses people.\rWe're lying in ambush for it here.
Stop, stop!\nYes, you!\rSunyshore City, which is down this\nroad, had a major blackout!\rCrews are working on restoring\npower, but the road's closed now.\r

What am I to do...?\rI've gone and dropped my Suite\nKey somewhere again...\rThe hotel people won't be happy with\nme...\rI'm sure I had it when I left the\nreception counter earlier...\rIf I only had the Pokétch app Dowsing\nMachine, it would be so easy to find...
What am I to do...?\rI've gone and dropped my Suite\nKey somewhere again...\rOh!\nThat's my Suite Key!\rYou found it for me?\nOh, that's sweet of you! Thank you!\r
