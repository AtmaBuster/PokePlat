Only the chosen may enter\nthe Snowpoint Temple.\rI'm sorry, but you will have to\nleave.\r
Only the chosen may enter\nthe Snowpoint Temple.\rI'm sorry, but you will have to\nleave.
The temple is said to have been\nbuilt in ancient times.\rIt pays homage to the Pokémon of rock,\nice, and steel that shape the land.\rSo it is told.
Candice: It's OK!\nYou can let that person in.\r
I heard from Cynthia.\rYou're working on a Pokédex,\naren't you?\rThere should be many rare Pokémon\nin the temple.\rEnjoy your exploring!
Brrr... This snowbound town is always\nfreezing cold.\rBut the spirits of the Trainers and\ntheir Pokémon burn hot and bright.\rEspecially the Gym Leader.
Your scarf looks nice and warm.\nI wish I had one like it.
I want to take a look around in the\nSnowpoint Temple.\rBut only really tough Trainers are\nallowed inside.
Pokémon are said to have dragged\nSnowpoint City here.\rThe Snowpoint Temple is their resting\nplace, they say.
Candice is teaching me about Pokémon.\rShe says I have to start by making\nfriends with Pokémon.
What is it? Do you want to sail\nto the Battle Zone?
Aye, aye, then!\nLet's set sail!\r
What is it?\nThe Battle Zone's rough to get to.\rThe sea around it is always roiling\nwith choppy waves.\rYou can't go there using Surf,\nthat's for sure.
A great Trainer recognized by\nthe Pokémon League...\rI look forward to carrying someone\nlike that on this ship!
There is nothing exceptional here.\nThat makes Snowpoint unique.\rThere's nothing exceptional about me.\nThat's what makes me stand out!
Cynthia: I thought you would come.\nI'm glad I waited for you!\r
Cynthia: I think it's good that our\nworld is constantly changing.\rOf course, I don't want it to become\nwhat only one person wants.\rA world like Cyrus envisions...\nNo one would want that.\rThe kind of world I want to see is where\neveryone can share their joy.\rWhere Pokémon and the people around\nthem can be happy for each other.\rI want the world to become a place\nwhere everyone is smiling.\rThe world could be so much better\nif we all tried to make it that way.\r
I want you to keep traveling to many\nfar-off places.\rI want you to keep meeting all kinds of\npeople and Pokémon.\rI came all the way here just so I could\nsay that to you.\rYour horizons will expand again if you\nvisit the Fight Area as well.\rI hope our paths cross again!\r
