Cynthia: I'm sorry I took so long.\rI think I finally found the answer\nfrom studying the myths.\rWhen this world was made, DIALGA and\nPALKIA appeared.\rApparently, there was one more Pokémon\nthat appeared at the same time.\rA Pokémon with as much power as DIALGA\nand PALKIA...\rBut also one whose name was never to\nbe spoken--GIRATINA!\rIt's said to lurk in another world...\nA world on the opposite side of ours...\rThat's what the shadow was.\nIt must have been GIRATINA.\r
The pillars are distorting...\rIt's because of that portal.\nIt's joined us to the other world.\rIf it's not closed, the distortion\nwill spread to Sinnoh and beyond...\rOur world will be destroyed...\r
Cynthia: Are you ready?\nWe have to chase Cyrus!
Cynthia: We have to hurry!\r
Cynthia: You need to get ready?\nI'll wait here.
Mars: M-Master Cyrus?!\nWhere did he go?!
Jupiter: That shadow...\nWhat was it...?!
Without anyone to guide us, we can only\npanic aimlessly...
              
                 
             
              
                                                
                      
An overwhelming feeling of time\nemanates powerfully from this rift...\rWhere does it lead to?
