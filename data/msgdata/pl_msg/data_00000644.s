Hold it right there, Trainer!\rIf you're in the Fight Area, you've got\nto visit the Battle Frontier.\rYou don't earn Exp. Points, and your\nPokédex isn't updated there.\rIt's a place solely for Trainers to\nhone their own skills.
Howdy, Trainer!\nYou have a Pokédex, do you?\rHere's my advice: go out and\nchallenge other Trainers!\rThey'll often have different Pokémon,\nso your Pokédex should fill up fast!
