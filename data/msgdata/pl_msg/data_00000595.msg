If you'd share your Shards with me,\nI can teach some moves.\rWould you like me to teach a move?
See you, then!
Which Pokémon should I teach?\r
There are no moves that can be taught\nto this Pokémon.
You don't have enough Shards.

I started living here where no one\ncould reach me without using Rock Climb.\rI came because I got sick and tired of\nseeing people.\rBut when I stopped seeing people,\nI began looking forward to visitors.\rWhere one lives can change people and\nPokémon, that's what I'm saying.
Red Shards emphasize power.\nBlue Shards are for special effects.\fYellow Shards are for status problems.\rRed Shards are what I like!
