Listen, listen. Do you have a Pokémon\ncalled MACHOP?\rWould you be willing to trade your\nMACHOP for my ABRA?
Be nice to my ABRA!\rI'll be sure to look after your MACHOP\nin return!
What I asked for was a MACHOP...
Oh, OK...\nWell, I can't make you trade me.\rBut if you change your mind,\nI'll be right here waiting!
Thanks to Pokémon, I got to be\nfriends with you!
A Pokémon obtained in a trade grows\nquickly.\rBut if a Pokémon grows too much, it may\nignore the Trainer.\rOf course, it won't matter if you have\nlots of Gym Badges.
When you trade a Pokémon, the item it's\nholding is traded as well.\rThat's pretty cool, huh?\rIt means you can send an item as a gift\nalong with your Pokémon in a trade!
