My daddy collects shards.\rIf you find any, like in the\nUnderground, please bring them to us.
My daddy likes Blue Shards.\rThere are other people who like shards\nin Sinnoh.\rOne person likes Red Shards.\nAnother collects Yellow Shards.
Red Shards emphasize power.\nBlue Shards are for special effects.\fYellow Shards are for status problems.\rBlue Shards are the ones for me!
