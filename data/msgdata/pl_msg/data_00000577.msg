The Day-Care Man was saying Pokémon\ngrow at different rates.
It's quite far from Solaceon Town to\nVeilstone City.\rThere's a café along the way where\nyou can get some rest, though.
The Hidden Machine Defog can be found\nin the Solaceon Ruins.\rBut my Pokémon can't learn the hidden\nmove.\rI'm going to give the ruins a miss, this\ntime.
Pikachu!\rI want to become more like a PIKACHU!\nWill you battle me?
Pi-Pikachu!\r
Pi-Pikachu!
I need to find a way to get more into\nthe character of a Pokémon...\rMaybe I should get the Day Care to\nraise me?
