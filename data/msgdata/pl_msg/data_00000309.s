Welcome to the Battle Frontier!\rThis is your first visit?\nRight this way, please!\r
Oh! You have a Vs. Recorder!\nHow nice!\rWe upgrade Vs. Recorders for first-time\nvisitors for Battle Frontier use.\rI'll borrow yours for a moment.\rLet's see... Slide open this part here,\nand ticka-tacka-kachunk there!\rAll done!\nHere you go.\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000's Vs. Recorder was\nupgraded.
Our other staff will be pleased to\nexplain how the individual facilities\fof the Battle Frontier operate.\rI can go over general topics.\nDo you have any questions?
Which topic should I explain?
The Battle Frontier has five facilities\ndedicated to battling.\rAt the Battle Tower, the objective is\nto beat seven Trainers in a row.\rAt the Battle Hall, you may keep battle\nrecords of individual Pokémon.\rAt the Battle Factory, you must win\nconsecutive battles with rentals.\rThe Battle Castle forces Trainers to\nmanage Castle Points to advance.\rAnd finally, the Battle Arcade is where\nrandom luck triggers events.\r
The battles at the five Battle Frontier\nfacilities are held under special rules.\rFirst and foremost, no Exp. Points\ncan be earned.\rConsequently, the Pokémon battling\nhere will not level up.\rIf the Level 50 rule is chosen,\nPokémon of higher levels will be\ftemporarily reduced to Lv. 50.\rPokémon under Lv. 50 will be entered\nwithout an upward level adjustment.\r
Battle Points are usually referred to\nas BP.\rBP are points that are used only in\nthe Battle Frontier.\rBP are awarded for meeting certain\nperformance goals at the various\fBattle Frontier facilities.\rBP can be exchanged for prizes at\nthe Exchange Service Corner.\r
The Exchange Service Corner is the\ntent straight ahead past here.\rThere, you may exchange your BP for\na wide variety of prizes.\rPlease do visit it!\r
The Performance Monitor shows Trainer\ndata, such as the previous record and\fthe best record to date.\rYou will find one near the reception\ncounter in each facility.\r
We hope you enjoy your visit!
