I'm using Technical Machines to teach\nmoves to my Pokémon.\rI'm trying for different mixes of\nmoves in different types.\rIt's for when I go up against the Elite\nFour of the Pokémon League.\rThey say the Elite Four are tougher\nthan any Gym Leader by far.
If your Pokémon gets frozen, it will\nthaw out after a while.\rBut if I were you, I'd keep some\nIce Heals around.
