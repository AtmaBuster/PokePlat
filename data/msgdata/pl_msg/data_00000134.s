The Great Marsh is vast!\nHow vast is it, you ask?\rTake a look from the Observatory\nand you can see for yourself!
Pastoria's Great Marsh was once\na part of the sea.\rThe seawater drained slowly away over\ntime, leaving the huge marshland.\rThat's why they say there are rare\nPokémon that you can only see here.
Would you like to battle with me?\nAs a memento of your visit to Pastoria?
I'll let you join my fan club if you can\nbeat me!\r
You're not interested in Idols?\n...I think I'm going to cry.
Well, that's me and my Pokémon!\nI hope you'll support us!\rJust so you know, our latest single is\ntitled “Jigglin' Pokémon Wub”!
Are we all ready to have some fun?\nOur battle will be fun! OK?!
OK, how shall we do this?\nShall we do something fantastical?\r
Oh, how shall I say this...?\nIt makes me all lonely, I say...
Well, let's see!\nWhich town will we go to next?
Come on, let's show off our Pokémon!\nLet's do battle, kiddo!
Your spirit's vibes...\nYou've got rock in your veins!\r
My guitar...\nIt lies broken and weeping...
Rock is about your spirit!\nBattling is about spirit, too!\fThat's why a battle is rock!
