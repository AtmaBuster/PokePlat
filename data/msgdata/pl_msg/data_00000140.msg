Everyone calls me the Pokémon\nMove Maniac. I prefer Move Tutor.\rI know every move that Pokémon learn\nwhile they're leveling up, and I can\fteach Pokémon those moves.\rI can teach a move to a Pokémon\nof yours if you'd like.\rI'll do it if you'll trade me\na Heart Scale.\r
Oh! That's it! That's an honest-to-\ngoodness Heart Scale!\rLet me guess, you want me to teach\none of your Pokémon a move?\r
If any of your Pokémon needs to learn a\nmove, come back with a Heart Scale.
Which Pokémon needs tutoring?\r
Which move should I teach?\r
Sorry...\rThere isn't any move I can teach\nthat Pokémon.
Hunh?\rDon't you think it'd be tough for\nan Egg to learn a move?

I often go to Solaceon Town for my big\nbrother.\rThe newspaper there gives me Heart\nScales for running errands.
