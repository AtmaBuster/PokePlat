When a Pokémon faints, it just means\nit doesn't have the power to battle.\rBut it can still use hidden moves\noutside of battle!
Team Galactic took my Pokémon away.\nThey took other people's, too.\rSomething should be done, but Team\nGalactic creeps everyone out...\rWhat are they doing to my Pokémon?
I got my Pokémon back!\rI'm so happy, I feel like riding my Bike\ndown Cycling Road together with it!
BUNEARY: Bunbun!
Hi, you cute little Trainer!\nWhat kinds of Pokémon are with you?\rThis Pokétch app will show how\nclose your Pokémon feel to you.\r
If you spend enough time with them,\nall Pokémon will open up to you.
Hi, you cute little Trainer!\nWhat kinds of Pokémon are with you?\rOh, your \v0100\x0000\x0000...\r
It seems to like you.\nIt must be happy being with you.
It's becoming comfortable around\nyou, I think.
Hmm...\nIt needs to get used to you more.
Two Pokémon!\nThat's what we need.\rWe're looking for a Trainer who's\ntraveling with at least two Pokémon.
Oh! Would you like to battle against the\nboth of us?
You're live on camera, but try to act\nnatural, OK?\r
OK, that's how it is, huh.\nCan't do anything about that.
Whee!\nWasn't that battle smoking hot?\rYou should make a Battle Video of it and\nshare it with the world!
Oh, dear!\nYou only have one Pokémon with you?\rThat's very commendable, but we can't\nbattle with you that way.
Giggle!\nCould you win against both of us?\n
We'll thoroughly check out your\nabilities as a Trainer!\r
Oh? You haven't healed your Pokémon,\nmaybe?
That was a good match.\rIt adds flair and drama when many\neager Pokémon get involved.
