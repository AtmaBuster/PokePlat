Oh, thank goodness that you happened\nto be there!\rIf it weren't for you, who knows how\nfar away my BUNEARY could have run...\r
Baby BUNEARY, back into the Poké\nBall you go!\r
I'm Keira!\nI'm a Pokémon Contest Judge.\rBe sure to drop by the Contest Hall\nso I can thank you properly!\r
Hey, there!\nHow's it going, Trainer?\rYou being here tells me you're going\nto challenge the Gym Leader.\rWell... I hate to break it to you, but\nthat's impossible.\rYou're questioning why, and the answer\nis: she's not here.\rNot to worry, though.\nWe know she's at the Contest Hall.\rCome back another time, OK?\nI'll be waiting right here.
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Ta-daah!\nKept me waiting again, \v0103\x0001\x0000!\rLet's see how much tougher you and\nI have gotten, right here and now!\rHey, you're a Trainer now. You're\nexpected to be ready for a battle.\rNo whining! No waiting!\nLet's get the show started!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Waaah!\nWhat are you saying? I lost again?!\rIt goes to show my surefire winning\nstrategy doesn't work.\rSay, hey, \v0103\x0001\x0000.\nRemember what I told you before?\rMake sure all your attacks hit!\nAvoid every enemy attack!\rI thought that was a wicked strategy,\nbut it doesn't work worth beans.\rI guess I have to grind it out and\ntoughen up the team a bit at a time.\rAnyway!\nWhere to next?\rThe closest place is Solaceon Town,\nI think?\rThat'll do! I'm off to Solaceon Town!\nSee ya, \v0103\x0001\x0000!\rYou'll be shocked by my growth the\nnext time we meet!\r
Did you know?\rThey found an Egg at the Day Care in\nSolaceon Town past here.
Did you know?\rThey find Eggs in the far-off Johto\nregion, too.
You're a Trainer, are you?\rYou've got two choices of challenges,\neither the Gym or a Contest, right?
At the Lost Tower, people unburden\nthemselves of unbearable sorrow...\rYou'll understand what I mean if you\nvisit the Lost Tower on Route 209.
This place is beautiful.\nPerhaps even too much so.\rPokémon, people, and nature are in\nperfect harmony here.
I can't decide what Accessories I\nshould dress up Pokémon with.\rThere are just so many kinds.
I get to see Pokémon all day long,\nbut there sure are many kinds.\rHow many are there now?
I used a Fire Stone on my Pokémon,\nand it evolved!
I'm visiting here all the way from\nthe Hoenn region.\rI had been hoping to find the Contest\nHall, but being new, I lost my way.\rFortunately, the local people very\nkindly led me to my destination.\rI was impressed by their kindness and\ngenerosity to a complete stranger.\rNow, may I offer you the courtesy\nof showing you to the Contest Hall?
Ah.\nPlease follow me.\r
This is the Contest Hall.\nPlease, do go inside.
It makes me happy knowing I've\nhelped another person.
Oh, I do apologize.\nI should mind my own business.
When I take my baby out in his stroller,\nI see the town in a different way.\rI notice things like stairs and bumps\nin the sidewalk.
Apapapu!
I went for a stroll in Amity Square\nwith my PACHIRISU today.\rWe came across a Pokémon feather\nwhile we walked.\rDo you think it'd make my PACHIRISU\nlook any cuter?
PACHIRISU: Kyukyuuh!
I have a professor friend, and this is\nwhat he told me.\rIf you leave a pair of Pokémon with the\nDay Care, sometimes Eggs are found.\rOr things that are like Eggs, anyway.\rI wonder how my pal Prof. Elm is doing\nthese days?\rHe was always a quiet sort and didn't\nreally stand out.
They call me Mr. Goods.\rNo one knows my real name.\nNo, not even I do...\rI dedicate myself to seeking rarities.\nIt's what I live for.\r
Hm!\nHmhmhmhm?!\r
                   
I was going to give you something,\nbut I just gave a rare thing away.\rI'll find something else for you,\nso just talk to me some other time.
             
                       
Oh? Your underground PC appears\nto be full.\rI'll hold your gift until you make\nroom for it. Tell me when, OK?
                                             
I'll find something rare for you,\nso talk to me some other time.

I can feel the baby stroller getting\nheavier each and every day.\rI wonder what kind of Pokémon my\nchild will become friends with first?
Papa! Mama!
I lived in total seclusion up in\nthe mountains for thirty years!\rI'm going to clean up some Contests\nwith a dance move I came up with!
I'd like to live in Hearthome when\nI get married.\rBut my boyfriend wants to live in\nVeilstone 'cause of its Game Corner...
I put my Vs. Seeker through its paces\na lot.\rI battled this one intriguing Trainer\nover and over using it.\rShe asked me, “Do you like me?”\nLike, oops! Hahahahah!
