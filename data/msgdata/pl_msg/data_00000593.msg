Oh? So, you are?!\nYou're Buck's friend, yes!\rI've heard about you from both Buck\nand Wake.\rWell, my young friend, you're always\nwelcome here from now on!\rThis is a private club for only Sinnoh's\nGym Leaders, or those vouched for by\fthose selfsame Gym Leaders.\rIt's a place where the best seek to\nbetter themselves.\rWelcome to the Battleground!
What should we talk about today?\n...Ah, I know.\rLet me tell you about the volcano named\nStark Mountain.\rThat volcano dates to when Sinnoh was\nmade by the melding of time and space.\rFiery lava spilled out and pooled, and\nthen it became a Pokémon.\rIt's said the Magma Stone was used\nto keep the Pokémon pinned down.\rIt kept the Pokémon from rampaging\nand the volcano from erupting.
Welcome to the Battleground!\nMake yourself at home like always.
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                  
Buck: My place is open only to the\ntoughest Trainers--I'm serious.\rYou're supposed to be introduced by\na Gym Leader, but you're special.\rWell, I'm off to the Battle Frontier.\rI feel like seeing how far I can go up\nthe Tower.\r
                                                                                                                               
              
              
              
              
              
Roark: I went down to the Underground\nevery day.\rI toughened up my Pokémon by digging\nup Fossils nonstop.\rCould I show you how tough I made them\nin a battle?
Roark: Here goes! These are my rocking\nPokémon, my pride and joy!\r
Roark: This is another topic, but you\nknow those Spheres you can dig up?\rYes, those Spheres.\nThe ones in the Underground.\rWhy do you suppose Spheres grow if\nyou leave them buried?\rIt's not a huge issue or anything, but\ndoesn't it strike you as odd?
Roark: Look, can I have some time?\rI feel lucky to have run into you here,\nso can I challenge you to a battle?
Roark: ...We lost control there.\rNext time, I'd like to challenge you to\na Fossil-digging race underground.
Roark: Would you like to battle?\rYou'll get to see a different me than\nyou saw at my Gym.
Roark: I've got a TYRANITAR I'm going\nto send out.\rIt's tougher than even my dad's\nAGGRON!\r
Roark: Hmm...\nThat's a heartbreaking answer.
Roark: Oh, you do want to battle?
Roark: Pokémon from ancient\ntimes...\rFossils that are yet to be\ndiscovered...\rI wonder if I can find new Fossils if\nI dig all over Sinnoh?
Roark: When I became a Gym Leader,\nI finally realized how great my dad is.\rNot that I'd ever admit that to him,\nof course.
Gardenia: Hi, have you been keeping\nwell?\rLet's cut to the good stuff!\nLet's get down to battle!
Gardenia: Yes, that's right!\rA battle will tell you if someone you\nhaven't seen's been keeping well!\r
Gardenia: You won't battle?\nYou're not in the mood, huh?\rWell, why not polish your Badges, then?\nThat might put a shine on your day, too.
Gardenia: Oh?\nYou do want a battle?
Gardenia: Out of the Gym, a Gym Leader\nis just another Trainer.\rBut wherever I go, I still try to be as\ntough as I can.\rIt's not fair to my Pokémon if we were\nto lose because of me.
Gardenia: My Grass-type Pokémon are\ngrowing good and strong.\rI'm kind of interested in what Pokémon\nyou have, too.\rWant to battle?\nA real quick one?
Gardenia: I can't deny that Grass-type\nPokémon have many weak points.\rBut I'll show you that's not the only\nfactor in deciding who wins!\r
Gardenia: Aww, really?\rMy grass Pokémon are growing good\nand strong, too...
Gardenia: My Grass-type Pokémon are\ngrowing good and strong.\rCome on, let's battle!\nA real quick one, OK?
Gardenia: By the way...\nHave you been to the Old Chateau?\rMe? Uh, well, you know, I have my Gym\nLeader job and all, so...\rWell, actually, I'm here training...\n...I'm here just for fun...\rAhahaha!\nDon't mind me!
Fantina: Finally, you have arrived!\rSo, you shall challenge me.\nAnd I shall win.\rYou will be startled by how much\nstronger I have become!
\vff01\x00c8Ohohoho!!\vff01\x0064\r
Fantina: You... You disappoint me.\nIt is very sad.\rBut, realize, you have not beaten me\nif you refuse.
Fantina: This time, you shall challenge\nme, yes?\rBut I shall win.\rYou will be startled by how much\nstronger I have become!
Fantina: You are an amazing person!\nTrès fantastique!\rI am delighted--for now I have a\npurpose!\rMy purpose, it is to defeat you!\nIt is a gift from you to me!
Fantina: Oh? It is you?\nAre you not taking part in Contests?\rSince you are involving yourself in\nContests, you should challenge me.
Fantina: Pokémon battles, they are fun,\nalways without fail.\rWhy, you ask? Because, in those\nmoments, we are at our most serious.\r
Fantina: No?\nWell, that is OK, also.\rJust seeing your face, it has made me\nhappy.
Fantina: Yes, what is it?\nI accept your challenge if you give it!
Fantina: I wish to battle as if I were\ndancing.
Maylene: I think it's OK if I were to\nkeep losing to the same Trainer.\rBattling that person tells me how much\nmy Pokémon and I have changed.\rThat's why I would like to challenge\nyou for a rematch now, \v0103\x0000\x0000.
Maylene: OK! Rei!\nOh, that's my bow before a match.\r\v0103\x0000\x0000, I'm throwing everything\nI have at you!\r
Maylene: Sigh...\rI braced myself for a battle.\nThis is a little deflating...
Maylene: Yes, what is it, \v0103\x0000\x0000?\nWould you maybe like a battle?
Maylene: I love visiting here.\rBuck's grandpa cooks for us, and it's\nall delicious.\rThat's not all! We can eat all we want.\nIsn't that amazing, \v0103\x0000\x0000?
Maylene: Being together with Pokémon\ngave me the strength to keep going.\rPlease, \v0103\x0000\x0000, accept my\nchallenge!
Maylene: OK, here we come,\n\v0103\x0000\x0000!\r
Maylene: OK! Got it!\rWe'll train much harder so we can\nbattle with you, \v0103\x0000\x0000.
Maylene: \v0103\x0000\x0000!\nI know I'm being a pest, but please,\faccept our challenge!
Maylene: Hello, \v0103\x0000\x0000!\rI've heard that it's more healthy to\ngo barefoot.\rCome to think of it, the Pokémon are\nall barefooted.
Wake: What's there to do for Trainers\nhere?\rSeems to me there's nothing to do but\nbattle!
Wake: My Pokémon have new Water-type\nmoves under their belts!\rLet's see how you bear up under them!\r
Wake: Then, you get my song instead!\nEr-hem!\rThe ring is my roiling sea. ♫\nThe towering waves shaped me.\rCrash! Crash! Crasher Wake!\nCrash! Crash! Crasher Wake!\rI'm the tidal wave of power to wash\nyou away!\rPut out the fire, Crasher Wake!\nRun from electricity, Crasher Wake!\rAh, ah, aaaah!\nThe ring is my sea. ♫
Wake: Words aren't needed.\rWe understand each other through\nbattle!\rThat's what makes us Trainers!
Wake: Battles that end with both sides\nenjoying the experience without caring\fabout the winner or loser...\rThat's what I strive for.\rOne of these days, I hope to battle\neveryone in the world...\rIsn't that right, \v0103\x0000\x0000?!
Wake: All right!\nHow's it going?\rMy Pokémon were toughened up by\nstormy white waters!\rThey'll take everything you can throw\nat them and then pull you under!\rVictory will be ours!\nCome on, let's get it done!
Wake: That's the spirit!\nBring it on!\r
Wake: Whoops!\rYou're giving me the slip?\nYou're a slick one, \v0103\x0000\x0000!
Wake: So, what's the story?\nAre we gonna battle?
Wake: For all the training I do, there\nare still plenty tougher than me.\rThe stronger I get, the farther away\nthe goal seems to be.\rThe road is harsh and long.\nThere's no end to it.\rBut beside me always are my Pokémon.\nEvery inch of the way!
Byron: I've faced many a challenger at\nmy Gym.\rI trained on Iron Island while\ncontemplating my worth for days...\rI have the confidence now to batter\ndown your defenses.\rCould I ask you for a rematch?
Byron: We are tempered and honed by\nbattling the strong.\rHere's to our showdown!\r
Byron: When you came to the Gym, you\nhad a glint that's dulled now.
Byron: I have the confidence now to\nbatter down your defenses.\rCould I ask you for a rematch?
Byron: I trained by pummeling steel\ncontinuously on Iron Island alongside\fPokémon...\rGwahahahaha!\nI could still use more toughening up!
Byron: Since we last lost to you, we've\nbeen in training.\rI think we've addressed our\nshortcomings.\rCould I ask you for another rematch?
Byron: Thank you!\rLike me, my Pokémon were longing for\nanother chance to battle with you!\r
Byron: Gwahahaha!\nThat's disappointing, but all right!\rThere's a lot to be learned by battling\nyou. We had our hopes up.
Byron: Could I ask you for another\nrematch?
Byron: Argh...\nCame up short again...\rDo I talk to my son Roark to train\ntogether...?\rNo, that's too embarrassing...\nHmm... This is a dilemma...
Byron: ...That Roark thinks he can show\nup his old man?\rMy act needs polishing still, I fear...\rAh, it's you!\nDon't mind me. Make yourself at home.
Candice: Hiya!\nWhat's up?\rI bet you can't tell what I'm thinking!\rI'll give the answer away.\nI want to battle with you!
Candice: This time, Candice is going to\npush through on willpower!\r
Candice: Oh...\nDid my willpower intimidate you?
Candice: Listen, listen.\nYou'll battle Candice, won't you?
Candice: Oh, wow, your scarf is totally\nin fashion.\rI wish I had one like that.
Candice: Candice is on fire!\rI'm blazing hot!\rHot enough to melt Ice-type Pokémon!\rI need a battle to cool me down!
Candice: OK! I'll show you how good\nCandice...\rI mean, how good my Pokémon can be!\r
Candice: Awww!
Candice: You really want to battle\nwith me, don't you?
Candice: Awww!\nThat's it!\rI'm going to train so I can throw a\nFocus Punch myself!
Volkner: Your Pokémon...\nI can feel their power!\rOf course, you can sense the power of\nmy Pokémon, can't you?\rLet us battle with you!
Volkner: Yeah! It's electric, this\nfeeling of anticipation!\rLet's do it!\nWe're going to make some sparks fly!\r
Volkner: Aww, come on now.\nDon't disappoint me...
Volkner: Hm? What's up?\nYou do want to battle?
Volkner: Winning makes me happy, and\nlosing leaves me angry...\rThat's no great revelation, but it's\nwhat makes me stronger.
Volkner: My ELECTIVIRE demands tough\nopponents.\rI'm willing to beg.\nLet's battle!
Volkner: You! And me!\nLet's make some sparks fly!\r
Volkner: Well, yeah, an ELECTIVIRE is\nintimidating. I hear you...
Volkner: Hm? What's up?\nYou're willing to face my ELECTIVIRE?\fAnd help toughen up my Pokémon?
Volkner: Some Trainers have Pokémon\nthey just have to have in their party.\rFor me, ELECTIVIRE is that Pokémon...
Cheryl: Oh, hello, \v0103\x0000\x0000.\nYou're my opponent of the day?
Cheryl: My Pokémon have been itching\nfor a battle.\r
Cheryl: Oh, but my Pokémon were itching\nfor a battle...
Cheryl: \v0103\x0000\x0000, may I ask you for\na battle?
Cheryl: Thank you, \v0103\x0000\x0000!\rThanks to you, my adorable Pokémon\nbecame a little tougher.
Cheryl: It's been a long time...\nHasn't it?\rWould you care to have a battle with\nme?
Cheryl: I should warn you, my Pokémon\ncan be quite rambunctious.\r
Cheryl: Giggle...\rPokémon would get worn out if we\nbattled all the time, wouldn't they?
Cheryl: ...Yes?\nWould you like to battle after all?
Cheryl: Being a Trainer isn't easy.\rThe more you battle, the more you\ndiscover.\rBut, you know?\nI love Pokémon for that, too!
Mira: \v0103\x0000\x0000!\nPlease teach Mira about Pokémon!
Mira: \v0103\x0000\x0000!\rMira will show you that Mira doesn't get\nlost anymore, \v0103\x0000\x0000!\r
Mira: Mira is a little sad...\nMira's Pokémon are stronger now.
Mira: \v0103\x0000\x0000, please?\nPlease teach Mira about Pokémon!
Mira: \v0103\x0000\x0000, please teach Mira\nabout Pokémon again!\rMira wants to get a lot, lot stronger,\nlike \v0103\x0000\x0000!
Mira: \v0103\x0000\x0000!\nMira is stronger now!\fPlease! Battle with Mira!
Mira: \v0103\x0000\x0000 will be shocked by\nMira!\r
Mira: Mira really did get stronger.\nMira wanted \v0103\x0000\x0000 to see.
Mira: You will battle Mira?
Mira: \v0103\x0000\x0000, you are always with\nyour Pokémon.\rThat's how you got to be so strong.\nMira is beginning to understand!
Riley: You and I, we're both Trainers.\rLet's forego the small talk and proceed\nright to battle.\rThat's my style!
Riley: Battling is our way of greeting!\r
Riley: All right, then.\nSo, what've you got to tell me?
Riley: See? It just doesn't feel right\nif we don't battle, does it?
Riley: Know your enemy.\rIf you know your opponent's Pokémon\nand what moves they use...\rIf you have intelligence like that, your\nchances of winning are much improved.
Riley: Hi. Long time, no see.\rIf it's all right with you, I'd like to\nchallenge you to a battle right now.
Riley: We're pulling out all the stops\nto put your Pokémon down.\r
Riley: Oh, all right.\nThen we'll wait till you're ready.
Riley: That look you have...\nI take it you're ready for our battle?
Riley: If I weren't on Iron Island\nthen...\rIf you hadn't arrived on Iron Island\nthen...\rPerhaps we would have never met.\nOr, would we have met elsewhere?
Marley: I...\nIs it OK to battle?
Marley: ...OK.\nI'll do my best.\r
Marley: ...Oh?\n...You can be that mean?
Marley: ...So?\nAre we battling?
Marley: ...You're so strong.\nIt makes me feel happy.\r...I don't know why.\nThis is a strange feeling...
Marley: ...Oh?\nA battle? With me?
Marley: ...OK.\nI...won't lose...!\r
Marley: ...Oh, you.\nI'm getting to dislike you a little.
Marley: ...If you won't battle, I might\nnot come back...
Marley: ...I might like battling with\nyou.\r...Just a little.\nOnly a little tiny bit.
Buck: Ehehehe! You're here at last!\nLet's not waste time! Let's do this!
Buck: ...I'm telling you right now.\nI'm seriously tough. Act surprised!\r
Buck: Huh, what?\nThat takes the wind out of my sails.\rWell, since you're here, kick back,\nmake yourself at home, and all that.
Buck: What? What?!\nSo we are going to battle?
Buck: Fweh! Too much!\rI guess I'll better my team\nat the Battle Tower.
Buck: One, there's no shortcuts in\nthe way of Pokémon!\rTwo...\nNever mind that, let's do this!
Buck: I can feel my Pokémon shivering\ninside their Poké Balls!\rIt's out of anticipation, not fear!\r
Buck: Hey! This place! It's named\nthe Battleground for a reason!
Buck: So?\nDo you feel like battling now?
Buck: Fweh! Too much!\rI guess I'll better my team on\nStark Mountain!
