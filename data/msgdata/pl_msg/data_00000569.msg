Grunt 1: Aren't we Team Galactic?\nAnd we're assigned here?\rStanding around among flowers...\nThis doesn't seem all that cool.\r
Grunt 2: Hey now! Don't complain.\nThis is a pretty decent assignment.\rBut Bug- and Grass-type Pokémon so\ncreep me out...\rI don't like being here either.
I wanted to get some flowers from\nthe Floaroma Meadow...\rBut some Team Galactic guys in snazzy\noutfits came along...\r
Those Galactic guys went to the\nmeadow past these flowers here...
Being surrounded by flowers puts me\nin an oddly pleasant mood.
I simply love it here...\nThe atmosphere is so uplifting.\rYou came to get emotionally healed\ntoo, didn't you?
Welcome to Floaroma, the town of\nflowers, flowers, and more flowers!\rYou should plant some flowers of\nyour own, too. Yay for flowers!
The Berries you pick can be used as\nfood for Pokémon.\rYou can also trade them in at the\nflorist's.\rThey'll exchange Berries for\nAccessories to dress up your Pokémon.
I got drawn here by the sweet scent\nof Honey...\rSeriously, what's that? What am I?\nA Pokémon or something? Mmm... Honey.
Oh, a SHAYMIN?\rIf you have that Pokémon, then you\nalso should have some Gracidea flowers.\rI've got a whole bunch, so you can have\nsome.\r
Gracidea flowers have been around a\nlong time in this region.\rThey're given as bouquets to express\nfeelings of gratitude.\rIsn't that charming?\rWith these Gracidea flowers you don't\nneed to say thanks with words.\rYou can, instead, demonstrate your\ngratitude with a bouquet. How nice!
Do you know about Gracidea flowers?\rThey're given as bouquets to express\nfeelings of gratitude.\rIt's an enduring tradition around these\nparts.
