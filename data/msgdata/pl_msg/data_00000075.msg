All Pokémon have a special power\ncalled an ability.
My favorite Pokémon ability is my\nPACHIRISU's Pickup.\rMy darling picks up a lot of dropped\nitems without me noticing!
The view is good from the second floor,\nbut it's a pain going outside.\rIf you don't mind, how about showing me\na Pokémon called GEODUDE?

Yeah, there are so many kinds of\nPokémon out in the world.\rI want to see them all now!
