Yahoo! This lodge's seen better days,\nbut relax, make yourself at home!
OK! You and your Pokémon are healthy,\nchipper, and good to go!
As you can see, the lodge is beat up.\rYou can do as you like--leave right \naway, or nap in the bed.\n
I don't have Thick Fat like some\nPokémon.\rThat's why I'm bundled up in layers of\nthick clothes.\rIncidentally, do you know what the\nability Thick Fat does?\rIt halves the damage taken from Ice-\nand Fire-type moves.
It's a bed...\nWant to take a rest?
\v0103\x0000\x0000 quickly fell asleep\nin the bed...\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000 and the Pokémon\nbecame fully healed from the rest!
