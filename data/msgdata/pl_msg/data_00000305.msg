Hi!\nMy name's Palmer.\rI remember you from when you were\nin Twinleaf, \v0103\x0000\x0000.\rYou were always playing with my son\n\v0103\x0001\x0000, right?\rYou've grown up since then, and most\nimpressively, too!\rSo, I'd like you to show me.\rShow me the bond you've built with\nyour Pokémon.\rShow me the skill you've acquired\nas a Trainer!\r
Palmer: So, you've come this far!\rAs the Tower Tycoon, I'll have to\ngive you my best effort.\rThat's how the best Trainers show\nrespect to each other.\rBy battling all out as dedicated\nstudents of Pokémon!\r
Bravo!\rI imagine many great Trainers will come\nto challenge me as you have just done.\rThat's something I look forward\nto a great deal.\rYou will become even more skilled,\nthe very same way your father did.\rKeep battling Trainers from around\nthe world and keep growing greater\fin stature!\r
Bravo!\nI feel inspired in my heart!\rIt brings back a memory of that day\nlong ago as a child...\rI went out to the lake with your father\nthat day...\rWe were attacked by a wild Pokémon.\rWe fended it off, but I don't recall \nhow. It was that desperate.\rThat was my first step as a Trainer.\rI wonder if the professor is doing\nwell?\r...That's enough reminiscing.\rMy young friend, the world and your\nfuture hold infinite promise.\rGo on, you can be all that you desire!\nThere is no limit to where you can go!\r
You have cleared your seventh match!\nCongratulations!\rIn honor of your talent, we present\nyou BP!\r
