Hello!\nWelcome to the GTS!\rWould you like to do a global Pokémon\ntrade over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection?
You may trade Pokémon one of two\nways at the GTS.\rYou may offer a Pokémon for trade,\nor search among offered Pokémon.\rShould I describe things in greater\ndetail?
You will be asked to put up the\nPokémon you are offering to trade.\rAt that time, you will be asked what\nPokémon you would like in return.\rIf another player offers your desired\nPokémon in return for your offered\fPokémon, the trade will go through.\rShould I explain anything else?
You may search among the Pokémon\nthat are offered by other Trainers.\rThey will all identify what Pokémon\ntheir Trainers want back in return.\rIf you find one that you want, you\nmust provide us with the kind of\fPokémon wanted in return.\rShould I explain anything else?

That's a big globe, eh?\rWhere do I live on it now?\nLet's see if I can point it out...
They say if you communicate with\nsomeone, their location is\frecorded on this giant globe.
All I need to do is leave a Pokémon\nhere to trade.\rWho knows, it might be traded while\nI'm asleep tonight.
You can easily trade Pokémon with\nPokémon fans around the world.\rIsn't that something?
You can register where you live on\nthis giant globe.\rOnce you do, you can show your location\nto anyone you communicate with.
Is Nintendo WFC something even I\ncan use easily?\rIf it is really that easy, I'd love\nto trade Pokémon, too!
This week, I'll do it!\rI really want to make the Top 8 of the\nrankings.
