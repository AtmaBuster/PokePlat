Hello! Welcome to the Oreburgh\nMining Museum!
Hello, hello!\nHow are you?\rI study Pokémon Fossils!\nMe! Right here and now!\r
You have a Fossil for me, yes?\nShall I turn it into a Pokémon?
Which Fossil should I turn back\ninto a Pokémon? Choose! Now!
OK, I will do that! Turn that Fossil\nback into a Pokémon, surely I will!
You don't wish that I extract any\nPokémon from a Fossil. Fine, then!
I am in the process of extracting\nyour Pokémon from a Fossil.\rYou go outside, yes, please. Now!\nTime alone is what I now need. NOW!!!
You were gone too long!\nYou kept us waiting! Unacceptable!\rThis is your \v0100\x0000\x0000!\nYou be good to it, OK!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000 received\nthe \v0100\x0001\x0000!\r
Give a nickname to the \v0100\x0001\x0000\nyou received?
But, no, I cannot do this!\nYou have too many Pokémon with you!\rI must hold it for you, so come back,\nyou, and take it away, please.
If it is a Fossil that you obtain,\nbring it to me if you must.
On the verge of a breakthrough, I am,\nto achieve extraction from Fossils.\rFrom Fossils I can extract Pokémon,\nbut not yet, not yet.
Whoa! So this is coal?\nI never expected something this big!\rAnd that color!\nIt really is as black as they say!
Wow! The Pokémon that carried this\nmust be terribly strong!
Well, how about that!\rThe Oreburgh Mine extends under\nthe seafloor!
It's a little far from here, but there\nis a city called Eterna City.\rI've heard a curious person named the\nUnderground Man lives there.\rWith a name like that, he must be an\nauthority on the Underground.
Mining must take a strong mind, not\njust a tough body.\rThink about it. You're in darkness,\ndigging desperately through rock.
The history of Oreburgh Mine...\rYou could call it a history of effort and\nfriendship between people and Pokémon.
How Coal Is Made   1\r“In a time long before history,\nvegetative matter was swept along\rby rain and rivers. It came to be\nburied under the ground.”
How Coal Is Made   2\r“The buried plant matter was\nforced ever deeper under the ground\rdue to tremors and fissures caused\nby the shifting landmasses.”
How Coal Is Made   3\r“Deep under the ground, the\nplant matter was subjected to heavy\rpressure and the heat of magma.\nIt gradually turned into coal.”
Samples of coal from different regions\nare displayed.
The box contains categorized samples\nof coal.
Different kinds of lamps are\ndisplayed.\rThey appear to have been worn\non someone's head while underground.
Badly scarred wooden tools are\ndisplayed.\rThey apparently dug out coal using\nthese tools in the olden days.
The everyday items and tools of\npast mine workers are displayed.
