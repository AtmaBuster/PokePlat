Reporter: I'm bringing you this report\nfrom the second floor of Jubilife TV.\rI'm here to examine a recently added\nphoto titled “\v011c\x0001\x0000,”\fwhich belongs to \v0103\x0000\x0000.\rOh, is this it here?\nLet's see...\rThe title “\v011c\x0001\x0000” does\nsound fitting for this photo...\rBut one can't help but think perhaps\na better title could have been found.\rAll controversy aside, it's certainly\nworth seeing.
