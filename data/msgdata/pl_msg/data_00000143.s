Grunt 1: Hey, you!\nYeah, you!\rThis is Team Galactic's warehouse!\nIt ain't no playground for kids!\r
Grunt 1: Hey, you!\nYeah, you!\rThis is Team Galactic's warehouse!\nIt ain't no playground for kids!
Grunt 2: This is the awesome Team\nGalactic's awesome warehouse!\rA little kid like you should be playing\nat the Pokémon Gym.\rAfter all, the Gym Leader happens to\nbe a kid just like you!
Grunt 1: What? Now you've brought\nyour buddy along so you can get your\fPokédex back?\rWe'll be just as happy to send both\nof you crying home to your mommies!

Grunt 1: Aww, that stinks!\nOur Pokémon are chumps!\rWe should get new ones from\nheadquarters.\rHumph! Who cares about some\nPokédex anyway?\rTeam Galactic's going to own\nall the Pokémon in the world...\fNo, in the universe!\r
There! Take it!\nTake your Pokédex!\r
Grunt 2: Those things we had in\nthe warehouse've already been moved\fto Pastoria City anyway...\rSo, we'll say “You'll get yours!”\nAnd run like the grunts we are.\r
Dawn: Hi, \v0103\x0000\x0000!\nPlease, can you help me?\rDo you remember Team Galactic?\nThose horrible people?\rThey tried to steal Prof. Rowan's\nresearch results in Jubilife, remember?\rI ran into them, and they took away my\nPokédex.\rPlease, I need your help.\nTeam up and battle with me!
Dawn: You and your Pokémon together\nwith me and my Pokémon...\rUnited like this, our dream team\nhas no chance of losing!\rI'm not letting those bad people get\naway with their dirty deeds!\r
Dawn: I'll be waiting.\nPlease get ready and come quickly.
Dawn: What's going on?\rWhy is Team Galactic out in the\nstreets like they own the place?\r
Dawn: \v0103\x0000\x0000, thank you,\nsincerely.\rI would've been lost without my\nPokédex.\rIt's indispensable for helping Prof.\nRowan with his studies.\rSo, \v0103\x0000\x0000, what are you going\nto do now?\rI'm thinking of going to the Pokémon\nMansion on Route 212.\rI hear they show rare Pokémon to\nvisitors there.\r
Lucas: Hey! \v0103\x0000\x0000!\nListen, I need your help...\rRemember those Team Galactic goons?\rThe guys who tried to take Prof.\nRowan's research results in Jubilife?\rI ran into them, and they ripped off my\nPokédex!\rWill you team up with me to take\nthem on?
Lucas: You and your Pokémon together\nwith me and my Pokémon...\rOur dream team's not going to lose.\nNot with the way we work together!\rI'm not letting those criminals get\naway with this!\r
Lucas: I'll be waiting!\nGet ready and come quick!
Lucas: What's going on here?\rWhy is Team Galactic out in the\nstreets like they own the place?\r
Lucas: \v0103\x0000\x0000, thanks,\nhonestly.\rI'm useless without my Pokédex.\rI have to have it for helping Prof.\nRowan with his studies.\rSo, \v0103\x0000\x0000, what are your plans\nnow?\rI think I'm off to the Pokémon Mansion\non Route 212.\rThey say they show off rare Pokémon to\nvisitors.\r
Looker: Have no fear, I have come\nrunning.\rI heard of children feuding with the\nTeam Galactic.\rIt turns out, of course, to be you.\r
Dawn: Oh...\nIt's that funny man from Jubilife...\r
Lucas: Hey...\nIt's that weirdo from Jubilife.\r
Looker: You insult me to my face?\nHow very uncouth of you.\r
Dawn: I'm terribly sorry.\rTeam Galactic took my Pokédex, so I was\nvery irritated...\rI just blurted it out...\r...I should be going now.\nBe wary of Team Galactic.\r
Lucas: Oh, sorry. Honestly.\rI was upset from having my Pokédex\nripped off by Team Galactic.\rI didn't even think when I spoke up.\rI'll be going now.\nUh... Watch out for Team Galactic.\r
Looker: It is of no matter.\rOf more interest is the criminal\nbehavior of the Team Galactic.\rThey attempt to steal the belongings of\na child?\rThe scale of their criminality, it seems\nrather minuscule.\rThe triviality of their action makes\nthem more sinister, perhaps.\rTheir warehouse needs investigation.\nCome with me, and we'll take a look!\r
There!\nWould you look at those antennae?\rI don't know what they do, but those\nare some mighty impressive antennae!\r
Hey!\nIt's you!\rI bet you don't remember me, but\nI sure remember you!\rBecause of you, they took my CLEFAIRY\naway...\rMy partner called it quits and went\nback to his old country...\rWaah! I know nothing! I don't know\nanything about any Storage Key!\r
Ah-hah!\nYou leave this to me!\rThe Storage Key for entering the Team\nGalactic hideout, I have right here.\rA frontal assault, it is not possible.\nBut we can enter their hideout.\rWell? Will you enter the hideout?\nYou have your reasons, yes?
Very well.\nInside the Team Galactic warehouse.\fWe will meet there.\rPrepare the best you can.\nI shall join you shortly.\r
Looker: ...Yes, I see your point.\rSneaking into the hideout of the Team\nGalactic...it is daunting.
Looker: \v0103\x0000\x0000!\r
We have the Hidden Machine that teaches\nFly stored in the warehouse.\rThey said I can use it if I show them\nthat I deserve it.
Yeah, Team Galactic is hiding all sorts\nof good stuff in their warehouse.\rI hear they even have a Hidden\nMachine in there!
The Game Corner is dangerous!\rWhy is it dangerous?\nIt's so fun, I lose track of time!
I got a TM as a prize from the\nGame Corner.\rI used it on my Pokémon right away!
Maylene is Veilstone's Gym Leader.\nThen, there's Wake in Pastoria...\rThey're way too tough for me.\nI can't even come close to them.
I came to this city just so I could\ngo shopping at the department store.\rBut with all these rock walls around,\nthis place feels kind of cold.
I bought a new parasol.\rBut I don't want it to get rained on,\nso I watch the TV weather reports.
Do you know where one might find\na Coin Case?\rI heard that there's a clown giving\n'em away, but...
Veilstone is the city of stone.\nWe even have meteorites!\rThis has nothing to do with anything,\nbut take this Technical Machine!\r
If someone uses Embargo on your\nPokémon, it becomes impossible to\fuse any items on it.\rAnyway, enjoy your visit to Veilstone,\nthe city of...well, stone.
Salut, Trainer!\nTu aimes les Pokémon?
Moi aussi!\nC'est génial!
J'ai du mal à te croire...\nIl n'y a qu'à vous regarder!
