The more Gym Badges you have, the\nbetter they treat you at Poké Marts.\rYou get to buy a better selection of\nmerchandise, you see.\rBut I don't have a single Gym Badge.\nIt's because Gardenia's too much!\rArgh! I don't want to see another\ngrass Pokémon ever again!\rIf only I had Flying-type Pokémon...\nThen my losing streak would end!
An Escape Rope is indispensable!\rI wish I'd had one when I got into a \ntough spot in the Eterna Forest.\rI would've been able to warp to the\nentrance instantly!
