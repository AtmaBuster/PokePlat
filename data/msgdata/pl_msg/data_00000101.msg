Oh, my!\nYou've met \v0134\x0001\x0000 Pokémon!\rWonderful! Yes, bravo!\nProfessor Rowan should be delighted!\rHere is something for you!\r
A Pokémon holding an Exp. Share will get\nsome of the Exp. Points from battle.\rIt will get Exp. Points even if it didn't\nactually battle.\rTherefore, it should be held by a\nPokémon you want to raise quickly.\rAlso, a Pokémon you get in a trade may\ndisobey you if it is too high in level.\rDon't worry, though. It will obey if\nyou have enough Gym Badges.
You've met only \v0134\x0001\x0000 Pokémon?\rHmm...\nYou've got to find at least 35.\rIf you can't, it will be tough to\ncomplete the Sinnoh Pokédex.
