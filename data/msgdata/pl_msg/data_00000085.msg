\v0103\x0000\x0000: Hey, \v0103\x0001\x0000!\rYou came to see the Pokémon statue,\nright? I'll take you there!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: What the...\r
Cyrus: ...So, this is Eterna's Pokémon\nstatue...\rShaping our world are time and space\nin an intertwining spiral.\rRevered in Sinnoh are the Pokémon of\ntime and space...\rSinnoh's myth...\nIts truth needs investigation...\r
...Pardon me.\nStand aside.\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Oh, hey!\rWhen we smacked together, a brilliant\nflash of inspiration came to me!\rAn easy way to become a great Trainer!\nYeah, that!\rAll right.\nListen close...\rMake certain all your attacks hit!\nAvoid enemy attacks for sure!\rYou do that, you'd never lose!\nYou'd be the invincible Trainer!\rAnyway, go check out the Pokémon\nstatue. See you around!\r
Oh, that device you have...\rIt is a Pokédex?\nWow, it brings back some memories.\rPardon me, but what's your name?\r...\rOK, hello, \v0103\x0000\x0000.\nI'll be sure to remember that name!\rMy name is Cynthia.\nI'm a Trainer just like you.\rI've been studying Pokémon mythology\nlately, just out of curiosity.\r
Here in Eterna City, there is a statue\nof an ancient Pokémon.\rHave you seen it already?\rAccording to myth, it was an extremely\npowerful Pokémon.\rWho knows? You may encounter something\nlike it while you're traveling with your\fPokédex.\rOh, I know! Try using this.\nIt should be helpful.\r
Cynthia: Remember, the hidden move\nCut can be used in the field.\rIt will let you go places that were\npreviously inaccessible to you.\rThat's important for filling up your\nPokédex, right?\rThen luck be with you, young Trainer!\rOh, there's one last thing!\nPlease give my regards to Prof. Rowan.\r
Cynthia: Oh, there you are!\rI was looking for you.\nI've got something nice.\rI wanted you to have this Pokémon Egg.\nWill you accept it?
Cynthia: That's wonderful!\rThe Pokémon inside the Egg is\nhappy, too. I'm sure of it!\r
Cynthia: Oh?\nYou have six Pokémon with you already.\fYou don't have room for this Egg.\rYou'll have to store a Pokémon in a\nPC Box at the Pokémon Center first.\rI'll give you this Egg when you've made\nroom for it.\rI'll be waiting right here.
Cynthia: Oh...?\nYou don't need to feel obligated.\rIt's hard filling the pages of the\nPokédex, isn't it?\rI only want to lend you a little hand,\nthat's all.
Cynthia: Oh, wait!\rDon't leave without this Pokémon Egg.\nPlease? I want you to have it.\r
Cynthia: Well?\nWill you accept this Pokémon Egg?
                               
Cynthia: Keep that Egg with you in your\nparty of Pokémon.\rA Pokémon will hatch from it while you\nare traveling.\rI would be happy to know that it will\nhelp fill another page of your Pokédex.\rSee you again!\r
Hi! I'm Gardenia!\nI'm this town's Gym Leader!\rMy last challenger was this awfully\nspeedy young guy.\r...Actually, his name was \v0103\x0000\x0000.\nHe told me about you.\rHe said that another challenger's on\nthe way, so that made me antsy!\rAt my Gym, no one gets to battle with\nthe Gym Leader, me, until the end.\rThe challenger has to beat all the\nother Gym Trainers first.\rI'll be waiting for you in the back,\nTrainer. Don't disappoint me!\r
Hey! You there, kid!\nStay away from that Pokémon statue!\rTeam Galactic is conducting an\nofficial investigation here!
Hey, you! Yeah, you, Trainer!\rErrr...\nIt's OK. Never mind. You look tough.\rI won't take... Um, I'll just let you\nkeep your Pokémon. Carry on!
Have you seen our building?\rTeam Galactic is so stinking rich\nthat we can have one built instantly!
Since that Team Galactic building went\nup, the city's atmosphere has gotten\fall creepy and tense.\rI don't know what those people are\ndoing up in that place...
With Team Galactic gone, what's going\nto happen to their building?
My friend said Team Galactic took his\nfavorite Pokémon away.\rI don't think he's telling the truth.\nTeam Galactic looks so cool.\fThey don't look like common thugs.
Do you use your Bike's kickstand?\rIt looks cool to hop off your Bike and\nthen snap it into place in one motion!
If you're visiting Eterna, you need to\nget yourself a Bicycle and take a\fride down the Cycling Road.
Oh, your Pokémon are rather fetching.\rWhy, they look ready for Contests in\nHearthome City!
They say this is an old city.\rIt doesn't look it, though.\nNot with all these tall buildings.
Eterna City's not anything like it\nwas before, way back in the day.
They say this is an awesome Pokémon\nthat people saw long ago.
Oh, don't tell me you don't have\nan Explorer Kit?\rYou should have a word with the man\nnext door to the Pokémon Center.\r
Oh, don't tell me you don't have\nan Explorer Kit?\rYou should have a word with the man\nnext door to the Pokémon Center.
Going underground with the Explorer\nKit is a blast, isn't it?
Oh, wow!\nYou got a Bicycle!\rYou can ride down Cycling Road\nand end up in Hearthome City.\rIt's a fast and fun ride.\nYou should check it out!\r

It feels great riding a Bike with the\nwind in your face, doesn't it?

It's Eterna City's Pokémon statue.\rThere seems to have been a descriptive\nplate, but it appears it was torn off.
