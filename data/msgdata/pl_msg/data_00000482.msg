Oh! The fog is gone and, with it, all\ndoubt in my heart!\rThis is my thanks.\nDon't be shy! Take it!\r
That Fantina...\nIt's hard to tell what she's thinking.\rBut she has a compassionate heart.\nYou know, she's a regular visitor.
I can't see!\nThis fog obscures everything!\rI wish this fog could be blown away like\nthe doubt in my heart!
Let me make your journey out of this\nplace less frightening. Take this.\r
The Lost Tower is where the spirits\nof departed Pokémon are put to rest.\rThose that enjoyed long lives...\nThose whose times were short...\rAll the departed Pokémon shall find\nsolace here...
I can't see!\nThis fog obscures everything!\rI wish this fog could be blown away like\nthe doubt in my heart!
