Maylene: Oh, \v0103\x0000\x0000!\r
Um, are you maybe on your way to\nSnowpoint City?\rThat's where I'm going, too.\rIf I use Fly, I can get there instantly,\nbut I'm walking for my training.\rI have no problem with this.\rI'm used to the cold because I go\nbarefoot and lightly dressed.\r...Achoo!\rOh, that was nothing.\nReally, I'm not cold at all.\rI'll be going now.\nPlease take care!\r
I'm using the Dowsing Machine on\nmy Pok√©tch.\rI'm looking for things buried under\nthe snow.
The boulder is encrusted with ice.\nIt is bone chilling to touch.
