\v0103\x0000\x0000: Whoops!\nHey, \v0103\x0001\x0000!\rYou're going to challenge the Gym\nLeader up past here, eh?\rSomeone should check to see if you're\nready for this challenge!\rThat someone is me!\nWith my brand-new Gym Badge!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Yeah, yeah, you're just\na bit better than me, as usual.\rBut listen up!\rLet me tell you who's going to take on\nthe Pokémon League and become the\fChampion.\rYou guessed right!\nIt's going to be me!\rAnyway, you should go to Iron Island\nand toughen up some more.\rYeah, train at Iron Island! That's what\nI did before going to the Gym!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Hey! That's the Mine\nBadge! Good going!\rYou're tough enough to consider\nbecoming the Pokémon Champ.\rOf course, I'm tougher, so it's\nnot going to actually happen.\rAnyway, \v0103\x0001\x0000, come with\nme to the library.\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Hey, you're here!\nFinally!\rOh, but what the...\rAww, you haven't gone to Iron Island,\nhave you?\rYou didn't get the HM Strength, did\nyou?\rAww, sheesh! I'll wait here for you!\nHurry up and go already!
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Too slow!\rCome on!\nLet's move it!\r
Rowan: ...That tremor...\nThat wasn't a natural occurrence.\r
Hey, hey! Old dude and kids!\nDid you hear?!\rThey're saying there was a huge\nexplosion at Lake Valor!\rBut, I hear everything's fine now.\nI guess it was just a lot of noise.\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Gramps!\rI'm going!\nI have a bad feeling about this!\r
Rowan: ...That \v0103\x0000\x0000...\nCan't sit still...\r\v0103\x0001\x0000, I don't like to demand,\nbut I need you at Lake Valor.\rIt's impossible for things to be OK.\nNot after an explosion like that.\rBut I have no idea what is taking\nplace...\rBut before you go, let me stress:\ndon't get in over your head.\rWe will try to join you as soon as\nwe inspect Lake Verity.\r
Dawn: ...\v0103\x0000\x0000, you'll be OK,\nno matter what, right?
Lucas: Lake Valor...\nI wonder what happened?
Dawn: We're going off to Lake Verity\nfirst...\rDon't do anything rash if something\ndoes happen.
Lucas: We're going to investigate\nLake Verity before we join you.\rDon't try to be a hero if anything\ncrazy happens.
Rowan: Hmm...\rWhat is taking place at Lake\nValor... You must find out!\rBut before you go, let me stress:\ndon't get in over your head.\rWe will try to join you as soon as\nwe inspect Lake Verity.
What's up?\nYour clothes look damp.\rMaybe you took the boat to Iron Island\nto get a Hidden Machine, right?
The tremor earlier was no quake.\nIt seems it was a mysterious explosion!
Welcome to Canalave City, the Canal\nCity!\rIn the old days, this port used to\nbe a hub of cargo transportation.
What was that tremor?\nI thought Mt. Coronet erupted!
There's a really impatient-looking boy\nhanging out in front of the library.\rHe's so jittery, just seeing him makes\nme feel twitchy.
I'm going to study at the library.\rI've taken an interest in the subject\nof time and space.
An explosion at Lake Valor?\nBut there isn't anything there?
My PSYDUCK is very close to me.\nThat makes its Return move powerful!
E-even PS-PSYDUCK's Future Sight\ncouldn't foretell that tremor!
PSYDUCK: Gua?
PSYDUCK: Gua! Gua! Gwa?\nGuaa! Guuagwa?!
The Gym Leader and Trainers of this Gym\noften go out to Iron Island.\rThey not only train their Pokémon,\nbut they work out as well.
I'm flabbergasted!\nWhat could explode at Lake Valor?
Do you wanna set sail?
Anchors aweigh!\r
You just tell me whenever you need\nto set sail!
Ahoy! You just go on and tell me\nwhenever you want to set sail again!
...You....\nYou're going to Fullmoon Island for us?
We're both counting on you!\rOnly you can awaken my son from his\nawful nightmare...\rPlease, I need the Lunar Wing from\nFullmoon Island to awaken him!\rI went, but I failed to find it...\r
Do you need to get ready?\rI'll be waiting here.\nWe're desperate for your help.
That Lunar Wing...\nPlease! Take it to my son...
You've been asleep for a long,\nlong time... What happened to you?\rAnd what were you doing here?\nNo one's lived here for fifty years.\r
