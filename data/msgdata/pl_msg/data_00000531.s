Were you looking for me?\nDid you miss me?\rI wish I had a new nugget of wisdom\nto share with you, but alas, I don't!\rSo, I'll have to make it up to you\nwith this!\r
Oh, why not? Take another!\nIt makes up for the wisdom I lack!\r
Those are my Nuggets!\nTry to spend them wisely!\rNuggets of gold have to be worth\nmore than nuggets of my wisdom!
