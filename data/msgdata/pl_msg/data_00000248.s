Hey!\nNow looky here!\rWhat you have there!\nThat is the Hidden Machine Defog!\rCan you loan it to me real quick?\nI'll make it worth your while.
OK, so I teach my STARAVIA the hidden\nmove Defog like so... And done!\rThanks! You're my rescuer! Hahaha!\nHere you go, my thanks as promised.\r
It's not like it's going to wear out!\nIt's just for a minute! Cheapskate!
I've finally got Defog, and it's all\nthanks to you.\rI'll get to climbing the Lost Tower\nnow that I've got it.
