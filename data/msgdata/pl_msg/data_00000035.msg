Someone broke my Pokémon-catching\nrecord!\rI'll reclaim my record and regain\nmy place in the standings!
I bet it'd feel great if I could be\nnumber one here!\rMaybe I'll enter some Contests with\nmy partner.
I really don't win many battles...\nBut it doesn't get me down.\rI'm trying for the world record\nat Pokémon fishing!
Sorry, I'm still fine-tuning this\nthingy here.
