Welcome.\nThis is Team Galactic Headqu...\rI'm sorry, this is the Galactic\nVeilstone Building.\rCosmic energy for the win!\rWouldn't it be wonderful if we\ncould harness that boundless energy?
Welcome.\nThis is Team Galactic Headqu...\rI'm sorry, this is the Galactic\nVeilstone Building.\rI'm not certain if it's a good thing or\nnot, but we have no plans now.
Team Galactic conducts R&D around\nthe clock here.\rWe focus on the development of new\nenergy resources.
This is where we, Team Galactic, work.\nWhat are we supposed to do?\rI'm not sure how, but we're supposed\nto chase our dream.\rOur dream of making a wonderful\nnew world!
We, Team Galactic, will take everything\nthat can be taken!\rWe will eliminate everything that is\nnot needed!\rThat is Team Galactic's policy!
We, Team Galactic, will take everything\nthat can be taken!\rWe will eliminate everything that is\nnot needed!\rThat is Team Galactic's policy!\rAt least it used to be.\nThere's nothing left now...
You're too young for us...\nYou can join us when you're older.
I wonder where our boss went...
Saturn: So, it's you...\rI've heard about you and what took\nplace at the Spear Pillar.\rOur leader, Master Cyrus, hated the\nvery idea of spirit.\rHe hated spirit for being incomplete.\rAnd yet, using fiery exhortations,\nhe rallied the spirit of others.\rWhat he hated most, he used to control\nothers. Isn't that ironic?\rThat fascinated me.\nI wanted to see what he would do.\rAnd I did. At his side.\nBut it's over.\rA world without spirit...\nWho would want such a thing?!\rSo, what now...?\nWhat to do with Team Galactic?\rBut I've learned that extremism\nis never the solution...\rPerhaps we should really be searching\nfor new sources of energy.\rInstead of lying about it through our\ncommercials.
The door is locked.\nA special key is needed.
The door is locked.\nA special key is needed.\rUse the Galactic Key?
The door opened.
The Team Galactic credo!\nEverything belongs to Team Galactic!\rLook beyond the world--space will\nbecome Team Galactic's!
