There goes the Egg I wanted...

Welcome to the Union Room.\rIf there is anything you need help\nwith, please let me know!
How may I help you?
Which topic would you\nlike me to explain?
In the Union Room, you may battle\nwith two Pokémon of your choice\fthat are Lv. 30 or lower.\rWhen you visit here, we recommend\nthat you bring Pokémon that\fmeet this requirement.\r
You may trade your Pokémon with\nother players.\rMeeting new people could be a\nshortcut to meeting rare Pokémon!\r
You may communicate with other\nplayers and mix your records.\rWhat will happen if you mix records,\nyou ask?\rWe recommend that you try it and\nsee!\rUp to five players can take part,\nso try it with your friends!\r
In a Spin Trade, participants each bring\nan Egg for trading with others.\rWhich Egg will you end up with?\nWhat kind of Pokémon is in that Egg?\fIt's quite exciting and fun!\rUp to five players can take part, so\ntry it with your friends!\r
You may get together with others\nand draw.\rYou all get to work on one sheet\nof paper at the same time.\rI'm sure a drawing made by friends\nwill be a memorable masterpiece!\rUp to five players can take part,\nso try it with your friends!\r
You can chat with other people\nby selecting “CHAT” in the menu.\rGo out and meet other players in\nthe Union Room!\rLet people know what you're like\nand what you'd like to do.\rMingle, chat, and add to your\ncircle of friends!\r
Oh!\nHere comes someone now!\rInstead of me, why not strike up\na chat with our newcomer?\r
It's rather boring if no one comes\nto visit...\rWhat might we do for entertainment...?\r
Do you sometimes get mistaken for\na real \v010e\x0000\x0000?\rI just seem to get that feeling\nfrom you.\r
Hello!\rThat's right!\nIt's important to say a greeting!\rIf someone arrives, let's try to\nbe friendly!\r
Greetings!\r\v011c\x0000\x0000?\nIt's wonderful!\fI really like it, too!\rWhen you meet someone for the first\ntime, the proper etiquette is to\fintroduce yourself.\rBy introducing yourself, you'll get to\nknow about the other person, too!\r
\v011c\x0000\x0000 Trainer?\nThat's what you are?\fIsn't that something!\rBut I'm sorry to say, I don't have\nany Pokémon...\rI would rather watch than battle,\nyou see.\r
Oh! Your \v011c\x0000\x0000!\nI would love to have it!\fPlease trade me!\r...\rI was actually joking.\rI don't have any Pokémon, so\nI can't trade with anyone...\r
\v011c\x0000\x0000?\nI can understand you'd want one...\rBut you shouldn't expect people to\nmake trades just for you.\rYou also have to consider what\nPokémon the other person wants.\r
Welcome to the Union Room!\rI'm the only one here now, but\nplease do bring your friends for\fsome fun and excitement!\rIf you have time on your hands,\nI'm also here to chat.\rYou see, I have a lot of time on\nmy hands...\r
I'm quite good at drawing!\rIf it's \v011c\x0000\x0000,\nleave it to me!\fNo one's better than me at it!\r
Oh, you're leaving...\r...\rIt makes me feel lonesome...\rPlease do come visit again!\r
What's wrong?\nAre you feeling down about something?\rIf you're feeling blue, it's much\nbetter to have fun with friends\fthan to be alone.\r
\v011c\x0000\x0000?\nYes, please!\r...I do want to join in, but I'm\non duty here, so I can't...\rSigh... \v011c\x0000\x0000...\nI wish I could...\r
\v011c\x0000\x0000?\nMe, too, please!\rBut I need to stay here and attend\nto our visitors...\rPlease enjoy it with your friends!\r
\v011c\x0000\x0000?\nYou're inviting me?\rOh, but I have to stay here and\nattend to our visitors.\rI'm sorry. I'd love to accept,\nbut I really can't.\r
That's right!\rSometimes, it might be better to\njust go and invite other people.\rBut don't get too selfish or pushy\nbecause you want to \v011c\x0000\x0000.\r
Yes!\nIt's OK!\rNothing is impossible.\rThink positively and keep your\nchin up!\r
Everyone has at least one thing\nthey aren't good at.\rYou should never try to make someone\ndo what they don't want to do.\rIncidentally, \v011c\x0000\x0000 is\nsomething that I would like to do.\r
Good luck! I hope you enjoy\nserious battles.\rYou can't experience ones like\nthis in the Union Room!\r
You want to chat?\rWell, you shouldn't be wasting your\ntime chatting with me.\rYou need to be more active and talk\nto other players.\rAfter all, you can't make friends\nif you don't talk to people.\r
Where are you?\nUm... Right before my eyes.\rOh!\nAre you maybe an impostor?\rThe real player is somewhere else?\r...That's ridiculous!\nPlease, don't be silly!\fMy word!\r
\v011c\x0000\x0000 trade?\nThat sounds fun!\fI would love to as well.\rBut telling me that won't help.\nI can't trade with anyone.\r
If you want to have a \v011c\x0000\x0000\nBattle, you need to be more\fassertive and talk to other players.\rIf you can't assert yourself, you\nmay never get a chance at a\f\v011c\x0000\x0000 Battle!\r
