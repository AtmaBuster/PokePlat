Grr... The package hasn't arrived\nfrom the Veilstone warehouse yet...\rI have to wait here until then?\nI'm going batty from this wait...\rOh, man, I wish I could do something\nthat involved lots of explosives!\rYup, this is going to be a smashing\njob for Team Galactic...
Grr...\nThis is so annoying...\rWhat is it, you? Oh, some kid with\nonly three Gym Badges.\rLittle rascals like you should know\nto stay out of Team Galactic's way!\r...Now, this package from Veilstone...\nWhere should I set it off...?\rYup, this is going to be a smashing\njob for Team Galactic...
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Whoops!\rHehehe! I'm not always going to plow\ninto you every time we meet!\rSo how's it going, \v0103\x0001\x0000?\nBuffing up your Pokémon, eh?\rI'll test you and your Pokémon out\nto see how buff and tough you are!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Heh, yeah, maybe you\ndid get a bit tougher since last time.\rThat even shocked me a bit, so yeah,\nI got beat 'cause I was careless.\rSo, hey, what was that Team Galactic\nguy all freaking out about?\rI don't know what he's up to, but\nyou should chase him down!\rIf you're not a Pokémon, and you run\nlike that... You're a bad guy.\rAll right, \v0103\x0001\x0000!\nNext time, I'm not holding back!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Oh, hey, \v0103\x0001\x0000.\nYou're out of luck, though.\rThe Gym Leader, Crasher Wake, I mean\nMr. Wake's gone off to Veilstone.\rThey said he had a practice match with\nVeilstone's Gym Leader Maylene.\rSheesh!\nI ended up missing him completely!
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Whoops!\rHehehe! I'm not always going to plow\ninto you every time we meet!\rSo how's it going, \v0103\x0001\x0000?\nBuffing up your Pokémon, eh?\rI'll test you and your Pokémon out\nto see how buff and tough you are!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Heh, yeah, maybe you\ndid get a bit tougher since last time.\rThat even shocked me a bit, so yeah,\nI got beat 'cause I was careless.\rOh, yeah, I joined Mr. Wake as an\napprentice!\rLike, I want my own theme song!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Oh, hey!\nYou got the Gym Badge here, huh?\rWhat'd I tell you? Mr. Wake--I mean,\nthe master--is pretty awesome, hey?\r
Wake: What's this racket, then?\nOh, it's you two.\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Oh, Master!\r
Wake: ...Listen, kid.\nI know your father. I won't deny that.\rBut I don't recall ever taking you on\nas an apprentice. Not in the least.\r
Besides, you two don't need me.\rYou can become strong on your own\nwithout being my apprentice.\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: It doesn't matter.\nI made you my master! I decided!\rBut forget that!\nThere's trouble brewing!\rThere's a Team Galactic goon in front \nof the Observatory Gate.\rHe said something about using a bomb!\r
Wake: WHAAAAT?!\rNo one messes with Pastoria!\nNot on my watch!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Hey!\nMaster! Wait!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Does my new outfit look\ngood or what? CROAGUNK's where it's at.
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Why are you talking to\nme from there?!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Hey!\rWhat am I, chopped liver?\nDon't forget I'm here, too!\r
Wake: So, where's this Galac...\r
\vff01\x00c8DDDOOOMMM!!\vff01\x0064\r
Grunt: Fweh! That was rough.\r
Wake: YOU!\nWhat've you done?!\r
Grunt: What've I done, you're asking?\nWell, technically speaking, it wasn't me.\rThe package that arrived, see, that\nwas a bomb, named the Galactic Bomb.\rMe, I was told to push the button.\nSo I did. Like, “Poink!”\rOh, that's right! Mustn't forget!\nThe test results need reporting!\rCheerio, then!\nYou daft codger, your mask's absurd!\r
Wake: The Great Marsh is invaluable...\r
You two! Do NOT follow me!\nDon't let anyone else in, either!\rThere'd be big trouble if there's any\nof that bomb left!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Hey! \v0103\x0001\x0000!\nYou go after that Galactic goon!\rI'm staying here like Master said!\nGotta keep others from going in!\rDon't let that Galactic guy get away!
\v0103\x0000\x0000: What's the matter?!\nWhy aren't you gone already?!\rGo after that Galactic goon!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: What's the matter?!\nWhy aren't you gone already?!\rGo after that Galactic goon!
What's with you?\nStop chasing after me, you.\rI've half a mind to pulverize you with\nmy Pokémon!\rBut I have to be on my way to the\nlake ASAP! So, you're lucky! I'm out!\rAll right, do I make myself clear?\nDon't you dare follow me!\r
Here where I am standing, I'm\nsmack-dab in the middle of town.
I study rare Pokémon that appear\nonly in the Great Marsh.
Some Trainers deliberately prevent\ntheir Pokémon from evolving.\rThey wait until the Pokémon levels up\nand learns certain moves.
I'm visiting here to see the Great\nMarsh.\rI'm staying at the lakeside hotel.
Pastoria's Gym Leader is awesome with\nhis water attacks.\rYou'll know what I mean when you\nchallenge him.
Wasn't the Pastoria Gym Leader kind of\nawesome in all sorts of ways?\rBut don't judge him by the way he looks\nand acts.\rI hear he enters professional\nwrestling matches for prize money.\rThat money goes to help people and\nPokémon in trouble.
The Great Marsh keeps the weather\ncool in the summertime.\rThis is a good town for Water-type\nPokémon.
CLEFAIRY: Fiiih?!
You're just like a totally impatient\nboy I met earlier.\rJust like you, he was very close with\nhis Pokémon.\rHey, thanks for making me smile!\nThis might put a smile on your face.\rTry dressing up a Pokémon with\nthis \v011f\x0000\x0000.\r
Someone gave me a Berry, so I\nplanted it and grew some more.\rThen, I took the Berries and cooked\nthem into Poffins.\rAll the work is worth it when I see\nhow happy they make my Pokémon!
I can't use the hidden move Surf until\nI beat the local Gym Leader.
Have you been to the Pokémon Mansion?\nIt's on Route 212.\rThe owner, Mr. Backlot, likes to brag\nabout his herd of rare Pokémon.
