Grunt 1: Enough arguing!\nHand over that sweet Honey!\r
Grunt 2: Do as we say!\nTeam Galactic will have that Honey!\rWe must have it to attract Pokémon\nin great numbers!\r
Grunt 1: Hey! This kid is a witness!\nWhat'll we do?\r
Grunt 2: We don't need the brat\nrunning off to get help...\rThe solution's simple!\nWe ensure the brat stays quiet!\r
Grunt 1: This is so lame...\nThey're going to dock my pay!\r
Grunt 2: I'm up next!\nHeheheh...\rBattling you right after my cohort\nweakened you gives me the edge!\r
Grunt 1: This brat's tough!\nLike, really, really tough!\rTougher than I can put into words,\nand I know a lot of words!\rWe're done for here... Let's get back\nto the Valley Windworks.\r
Oh, what's this thing?\nThey seem to have forgotten it...\rIt's a Works Key...\nIt must be for the Valley Windworks!\rIt's of no use to me.\nYou may as well have it.\r
Thank you!\nYou surely saved me.\rThose goons were trying to rob me\nof my sweet, sweet Honey.\rThey sure were weird, though.\nYou saw how they were dressed.\rWhat they were saying didn't make\na whole lot of sense, either.\rOh! I need to thank you!\nThis sweet, sweet Honey!\fGo on, take a whole lot!\r
Slather that Honey on a sweet-smelling\ntree. It might attract Pokémon.
Would you like to buy some Honey for\nattracting Pokémon? Just $100 each!
          
Oh, too bad!\nSeems to me your Bag's full.\rYou can't hold any more Honey, a shame\nthough it is.
Oopsy!\nYou don't have enough money.
Oopsy!\nWell, come again.
