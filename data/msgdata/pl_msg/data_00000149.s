Please enjoy yourself.
Would you care for a Protein?\nIt's a drink that boosts Attack.
May I suggest a Carbos? It's a drink\nthat boosts the base Speed stat.
When you need to make sure attacks hit\nthe target hard... Dire Hit is for you.
If your Pokémon has trouble with aim,\ntry treating it to an X Accuracy.
Where can I find matching dresses for\nmyself and my dear Pokémon?
I'm going to give an HP Up to\nmy KRICKETOT.\rThis is going to raise its HP, huh?
I'm getting the Carbos!\nI should get a Protein instead, maybe.\fBut Iron's not bad, either.
We're giving away a Pokétch app for\nfree as a promotion.\rI can give you the Counter app\nover the counter. Would you like it?
OK, here you go.\nGo forth and count!\r
I hope that Counter app I gave you\nis useful.
