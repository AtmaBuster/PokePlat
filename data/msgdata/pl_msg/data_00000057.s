It's easy to get to Iron Island.\nIt's one boat trip from here.
I was lucky enough to get a\nStrength HM from Iron Island.\rBut I can't use it for moving boulders\nuntil I beat Byron, the Gym Leader.\rI should make a note of that on the\nPokétch app Memo Pad.
It's possible for one kind of Pokémon\nto have different abilities.\rThat's news to me!
I heard this cool rumor.\rIf you can get on Nintendo Wi-Fi\nConnection, you can go to the Wi-Fi\fPlaza.\rThe access to the Wi-Fi Plaza is through\nthe basement of any Pokémon Center.
Come on, let's show off our Pokémon!\nLet's do battle, kiddo!
Your spirit's vibes...\nYou've got rock in your veins!\r
My guitar...\nIt lies broken and weeping...
Pokémon and rock 'n' roll are all\nanyone needs to survive in this world!
