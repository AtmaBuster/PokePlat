I'm going to be a Sailor like my\ndaddy!\rHe's a real man among men!\nEven the sea doesn't scare him!\rOh, but a Gym Leader'd be cool, too!\nByron is so awesome!
The little boy is thrashing about\nin his sleep.\rHe appears to be in torment...\nHe is muttering something...\r“DAR...\nDARK...is watching...me...”
The little boy is thrashing about\nin his sleep.\r\v0103\x0000\x0000's Lunar Wing began\nto glow...\rThe boy's sleeping face became\nuntroubled and serene!\r
The little boy woke up!
I couldn't wake up...\nI saw it...\rIt was a scary dream...\nIt was a dark place...\fAnd there was a dark Pokémon...\rBut, Daddy, Mommy...\nI could always hear your voices...
Oh, my gosh!\nYou're awake!\rOh, my son...\nI... I don't know what to say...\r
Thank you!\nWe'll never forget you!\r
Seeing you back to normal makes\nme feel great!\rI've regained my spirit as a Sailor!\nCome sail with me later!\r
Our boy has too much energy!\n...That's the best way to be!
I never thought our boy would fall into\nthis endless nightmare...\rIt's happened in the past in\nCanalave...\rThere were people who never woke\nup from their nightmares...\r...That is, until they were awoken using\nsomething called the Lunar Wing.\rMy husband went to find a Lunar Wing\non Fullmoon Island, but he failed...\rDoes it take a Trainer to do that?\nWe feel so frustrated by this...
Thank you! We can't thank you\nenough, but thank you!
