Battle Tower... Its height is a symbol\nof its challenge to Trainers.
All the places in the Battle Frontier\nlet you team up with a friend!
I don't think it's good enough for an\nIdol to just be cute, sing, and dance.\rI should learn more about Pokémon so\nI can attract the Poké maniacs.
I get to battle with the world's best\nin do-or-die situations here.
The most important person in the Battle\nCastle is a lady.\rLady, like a princess, I mean.
What makes me the most happy being\na Trainer?\rThe fact that Pokémon will always be\nwith me!
Behind every Pokémon, there is a\nstory. Isn't that right, dear?
Like a Pokémon and Trainer, we have\nbeen together for a long time.\rEventually, we will be parted...\rUntil then, I will cherish the time we\nhave, dearest.
People expect so much from a maid.\nCooking, cleaning, and laundry...\rNot to mention being good at training\nPokémon!
To be strong is to be weak.\nTo be weak is to be strong.\rI was told that a long time ago.\nNot that I have any clue what it means.
There are those who love battling from\ndeep in the cockles of their hearts.\rThe people that gather here?\nThat would be them.
I wonder how many years it's been since\nI first met a Pokémon?\rHow much time has passed for you and\nyour Pokémon?
Trainers can command Pokémon to\nuse moves in battle with confidence.\rThey can do that because Trainers\nbelieve in their Pokémon.\rIn turn, Pokémon repay that trust\nby using moves the best they can.\rThis may seem obvious, but it's actually\nincredibly amazing!
I treat every battle as if it were my\nlast.\rGoing into battle willing to accept\na loss? Unforgivable!\rBut losing is also inevitable.\nA good Trainer learns from it.
The Pokémon's type!\rThe moves to be learned!\rThe items to be held!\rIf your aim is to be no. 1 here,\nyou can't overlook a single detail.
You know, when I lose, the first thing\nI do is look for who to blame.\rLike, the opponent cheated, or I was\nunlucky, or it's my Pokémon's fault...\rBut I know I shouldn't do that.\nI won't get better unless I change.
There are five facilities in the Battle\nFrontier.\rAt every one, you can win your way\nthrough to challenge the boss.\rI think they're called Brains, and\nthey're out-of-this-world tough!
I know it's no revelation now, but...\nThe way of Pokémon is deep.
At the Battle Factory, you have to\nkeep winning with rental Pokémon.\rIt's a real test of your knowledge.\nIt's perfect for a student like me!
The Battle Hall is where I want to be.\rEven the MAGIKARP I caught fishing\nhas a shot at no. 1!
My inflatable tube lets me ride out\nthe ebbs and flows of life.

A Trainer who just caught a Pokémon.\nThat's what this statue represents.
“Boastful of Capture”...\nThat seems to be the title.
This...!\nA scale model of the Battle Frontier.
