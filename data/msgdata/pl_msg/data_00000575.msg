\v0103\x0000\x0000: Hey, \v0103\x0001\x0000!\rI got something cool.\nI'll show you as a special favor!\r
Huh?\nWhat the...\rWhat's this all about?\r...I got some Seals, but I forgot to\nput them on.\rOh, right.\nIt's because I was at the ruins.\rThe ruins here are cool.\nYou have to check it out.\rI even found a Hidden Machine.\nIt was Defog!\rAnyway, I'll battle you another time.\nSee ya!\r
Breathing in this refreshing air...\nIt perks up Pokémon, don't you think?
Howdy, traveling Trainer.\nTake it easy, slow, and casual.
Howdy, traveling Trainer.\nThere's nothing here.\rWell, nothing but plenty of time to\nthink, anyway.\rOh, right. We have the ruins here.\nWhy not take a tour through that?
I'm too little, so I don't know\nhow to battle very good.\rThe nice Day-Care Lady is raising\nmy Pokémon for me.
Every Sunday, I visit the Lost\nTower...
There used to be nothing here but\na road that went straight through.\rOver time, Pokémon and people just\ngathered, and the town came to be.
A traveling Trainer, huh?\rTell me, how many kinds of Pokémon\nhave you met so far?\rIf you're a competent Trainer, I'd\nthink you'd've met at least fifty.\rIf you haven't, go farther abroad and\nsearch wider, youngster.
Your encounters with Pokémon can\nbe considered your shared history.\rThis here's a Pokétch app called\nPokémon History.\rUse it to see your history of\nPokémon catches.\r
You have your history, and each\nPokémon has its own history.\rWhen the two collide, new drama\nis born.
