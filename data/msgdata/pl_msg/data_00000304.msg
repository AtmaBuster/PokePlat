Thank you so much for participating!\nPlease come again!
There doesn't appear to be any\ndata yet...
DS Wireless Communications will\nbe launched.
We look forward to your next visit.\r
You can call me the Judge.\rHeheh, it's actually not my real name,\nbut that's what everyone calls me.\rIt's because of this weird power I\nhave. It's a gift, really.\rI can discern, judge you can say, the\noverall potential of individual Pokémon.\rIf you'd like, I could judge the\nintriguing potential of your Pokémon.\r
If you'd like, I could judge the\nintriguing potential of your Pokémon.\r
...Oh.\nYou don't need me to judge. I get it.
Judge an Egg?!\nThat's a tall order even for me.\r
I see, I see...\rThis Pokémon's potential is decent all\naround.\rThat's my judgment, and it's final.\r
I see, I see...\rThis Pokémon's potential is above\naverage overall.\rThat's my judgment, and it's final.\r
I see, I see...\rThis Pokémon has relatively superior\npotential overall.\rThat's my judgment, and it's final.\r
I see, I see...\rThis Pokémon has outstanding potential\noverall.\rThat's my judgment, and it's final.\r
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its HP.\r
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its Attack stat.\r
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its Defense stat.\r
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its Sp. Atk stat.\r
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its Sp. Def stat.\r
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its Speed stat.\r
It's rather decent in that regard.\nThat's how I judged it.
It's very good in that regard.\nThat's how I judged it.
It's fantastic in that regard.\nThat's how I judged it.
It can't be better in that regard.\nThat's how I judged it.
A Ribbon will be awarded to the\nparticipating Pokémon!
