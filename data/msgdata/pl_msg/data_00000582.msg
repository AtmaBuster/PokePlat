The Pokémon in this town's ruins look\nlike some kind of strange alphabet.\rI think they're really neat.\nI'm too small to catch them, though.\rInstead, I play with Seals to try\nreading those weird letters.\rIf you can give me Pokémon that look\nlike letters, I'll give you some Seals.
Oh, that \v0100\x0000\x0000 looks just like\nmy Seals!\rI'll give you a bunch of Seals that\nlook like it.\r
                                               
I wanted to give you some Seals,\nbut you don't have a Seal Case!\rYou should talk to my mom!
The \v010a\x0000\x0000 were\nput away in the Seal Case.
You can customize Poké Balls by\naffixing Seals on them.\rOh, you don't have a Seal Case?\nWell, here you go!\r
Next, some Seals.\nHere you go!\r
I'll explain how the Seals work.\nYou'll need a Pokémon Center PC.\rFirst, select your PC, then check the\nheading “Ball Capsules” in the\fPC menu.\rNext, choose a Capsule and apply\nSeals to it as you wish.\rWhen you're done, put the Capsule\non a Poké Ball.\rYou can see the results when you use\nthat Pokémon in battle.
