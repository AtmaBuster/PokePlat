Too slow!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: All right!\nLet's get moving to Prof. Rowan's lab.\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: ...\n...\rWhat?\nDon't go into the grass, right?\fNo worries! No problem!\rIt doesn't matter that we don't have\nany Pokémon.\rTrust me on this one.\nI've got an idea!\rNow listen. You know how wild Pokémon\njump out when you go into tall grass?\r
So, what you do is, you scoot over to\nthe next patch of grass before any\fwild Pokémon can appear!\rIf we just keep dashing, we can get to\nSandgem Town without running into\fwild Pokémon!\rOK, stick with me!\r
OK, here goes!\rOn your marks...\r
\vff01\x00c8Hold it!\vff01\x0064\r
Professor: You two don't seem to have\nany Pokémon between you?\rThen, what is the meaning of going into\nthe tall grass?!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: ...\n...\r
Professor: ...\n...\r...\n...\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Hey, \v0103\x0001\x0000.\nThis old guy...\rIt's Prof. Rowan, isn't it?\nWhat's he doing here...?\r
Professor: ...\n...\rThey tried to go into the tall grass\nbecause they wanted Pokémon...\rHmm...\nWhat to do...?\rTheir world would surely change if\nthey were to meet Pokémon...\rIs it right for me to put them on that\npath...?\r...\n...\r
You two.\nYou truly love Pokémon, do you?
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Whoa, hold up!\nYou're not making any sense here!\r
Professor: Er-hem!\rI didn't quite catch that, so I will\nask you again.\rYou two.\nYou truly love Pokémon, do you?
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Me, too!\nI love Pokémon, too!\r
Professor: I will ask you once again.\rYou two.\nYou truly love Pokémon, do you?\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: What?!\nYou can ask a hundred times!\fThe answer will never change!\rWe'll both answer a hundred times,\nwe love Pokémon!\r
Right, \v0103\x0001\x0000?
\v0103\x0000\x0000: ...\nThat joke's getting old!\r
Professor: ...A pair of reckless kids\nwho foolishly try to enter tall grass\fwithout Pokémon of their own...?\rIt worries me what people like that\nwould do with Pokémon.\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: ...Uh...\nWell, I, uh...\r...\n...\rWell, then forget about me, but give\na Pokémon to my friend here!\rI mean, it was me who tried to go into\nthe tall grass and all...\r
Professor: !\rHow big of you...\rVery well, then!\nI will entrust you two with Pokémon!\rI apologize for putting you through\nthat exercise.\rHowever!\rYou must promise me that you will never\nrecklessly endanger yourselves again.\rNow, then...\rHm?\nNow, where...?\r
Dawn: Professor Rowan.\rYou left your briefcase at the lake!\r
Oh?\nIs something wrong here?\r
Lucas: Professor Rowan!\rYou left your briefcase behind at\nthe lake.\r
Is something wrong here?\r
Rowan: Ah! There it is!\nDawn, nice work.\rWhat I was about to do was to entrust\nthese two with their own Pokémon.\r
Rowan: Ah! There it is!\nLucas, nice work.\rWhat I was about to do was to entrust\nthese two with their own Pokémon.\r
Dawn: Pardon?!\rThose Pokémon are hard to replace.\nAre you sure about giving them away?\r
Lucas: Wha...?!\rThose Pokémon are crucial.\nYou're giving them away?\r
Rowan: Hm!\rWe exist side by side with Pokémon.\rThere comes a time when people should\nmeet Pokémon.\rThere is a world that should be\nexplored together.\rFor them, today is that time.\nThe place, right here.\r
Go on! Open the briefcase and choose\na Pokémon!\r
Rowan: Go on! Open the briefcase and\nchoose a Pokémon!
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Really?!\nProf. Rowan!\rI can't believe it! I'm so happy now\nthat I can't keep a straight face!\r
Hey, \v0103\x0001\x0000.\nYou can choose first.\rHey, I'm practically a grown-up.\nI have to show some class here.
\v0103\x0000\x0000: What's up with you?\nOpen the briefcase and pick a Pokémon!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Then, I choose you!\nI'm picking this \v0100\x0002\x0000!\r
Rowan: Very well! Both of you have\nchosen a good Pokémon, it seems.\rNow, listen well!\rThe Pokémon you have been entrusted\nwith are unfamiliar with the world.\rIn that regard, they're much\nlike you.\rAs fellow newcomers to the world,\nI hope you'll do well together.\r
If you have any trouble, come see me\nat my lab in Sandgem Town.\rAnd now, we'll be on our way.\r
Dawn: Professor!\nWait for me, please!\r
I'm sorry...\nPlease let me pass.\r
Lucas: Professor!\nWait for me!\r
Uh, sorry, folks.\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: How do you like that?\nProf. Rowan's really nice.\rOn TV, he seems so stern and scary.\r
Heheh, \v0103\x0001\x0000!\nWe've both got Pokémon now.\rThere's only one thing to do, right?\nAre you up for this?\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: What's with that attitude?\nDon't be that way!\r
                                         
\v0103\x0000\x0000: I've always wanted to\nsay this...\rThe time has finally come!\r\v0103\x0001\x0000!\nI challenge you to a battle!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Whew!\nLet's go home.\rI'm beat after that battle.\nMy Pokémon needs rest, too.\rSee ya, \v0103\x0001\x0000!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Aha...\nAhaha... I won? I won!\rBut that battle, it could've gone\neither way. It was that close!\rI can tell you one thing: battling is\nawesomely fun!\rOK, let's go home.\rI'm beat after that battle.\nMy Pokémon needs rest, too.\rSee ya, \v0103\x0001\x0000!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Too slow!\n\v0103\x0001\x0000, I'm sick of waiting!\rI'm going to go see Prof. Rowan, so I\ncan thank him properly.\rSo, I had this great idea.\nListen up, OK?\rYou know that lake where we always\nplay at?\rYou know how they say a legendary\nPokémon lives there?\rYou guessed it!\nLet's catch that Pokémon.\rThat'll make Prof. Rowan happy.\nI'm sure of that!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Me and you together,\nwe've got nothing to fear!
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Heheh, \v0103\x0001\x0000.\nThe lake's not that way!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Hey, \v0103\x0001\x0000!\nI said, the lake's not that way!\r
Wild Pokémon lurk in tall grass. They\ncan come bursting out at any time.\rSo, if you're wanting to battle wild\nPokémon, just walk in tall grass.\rIf you want to avoid wild Pokémon,\nthen stay out of the tall grass.
Hi!\nI work at a Pokémon Mart.\rDid you know that a Pokémon's health\nis measured by Hit Points (HP)?\rIf a Pokémon runs out of HP, it\nfaints and can't battle anymore.\rIf a Pokémon's HP gets low, you\nshould heal it with a Potion.\rHere, let me give you a Potion as\na free sample. First one's free!\rIt will automatically go in the\nMedicine Pocket of your Bag.\r
You can find a Pokémon Mart in cities\nand most major towns.
That ledge is one way. Jump down\nfor a shortcut to Twinleaf Town!
If your Pokémon's health--that's its\nHP--is getting low, you should go\fhome and get some rest.
If your Pokémon's health--that's its\nHP--is getting low, you should go\fto a Pokémon Center!
