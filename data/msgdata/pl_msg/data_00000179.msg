Maylene: Brrr...\rOh, hi, \v0103\x0000\x0000!\nAre you taking the Gym challenge now?\rI'm hoping to see Candice soon, but I'm\nstaying put until I warm up again first.\rOh, you should know that Candice is\na user of Ice-type Pokémon.\rI really admire Candice.\nShe's so studious.\rShe wanted to practice against me to\nlearn about the Fighting type.\rIt's because the Ice type matches up\nbadly against the Fighting type.\n
Maylene: Oh! That's the Icicle Badge!\nYou must have beaten Candice.\rWith that Badge, aren't you allowed to\nuse the hidden move Rock Climb?\rRock Climb can be learned by Rock-type\nor Fighting-type Pokémon, I think.
You know how there are many Ice-type\nPokémon around Snowpoint City?\fI wonder if they also live in the temple?
Sound gets swallowed up by the snow.\nThat's why it's very quiet here.
PSYDUCK: Gaga guwawa!
Thank you for coming to Grace's live\nshow in Snowpoint!\rI'm so happy you came to see me!\nI'll battle you as my thank-you!
I'll let you join my fan club if you can\nbeat me!\r
But my song!\nIt's nicer than that Crasher Wake's!
My dream is to be the top Idol!\rTo win everyone's heart, I'll sing my\nheart out in snowy Snowpoint!\r...To a crowd of none.\n...This is Grace. Thanks for listening...
