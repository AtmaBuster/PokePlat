Rowan: Ah, \v0103\x0000\x0000!\rYou've come to show me the progress\nyou've made on your Pokédex?
Hmm...\rYou've spotted \v0134\x0000\x0000 Pokémon in\nSinnoh...\r
What's wrong?\rYou're not suggesting you've seen so\nfew that you're afraid to show me?
                                             
I see!\rYou've met all the Pokémon there\nare in Sinnoh!\r\v0103\x0000\x0000, I need to see you\nat my lab. I'll be waiting!
I see!\rYou've met all the Pokémon there\nare in Sinnoh!
Look harder for wild Pokémon.\rDon't be afraid of going into tall\ngrass.
Your pace is picking up.\nThings can only get better!
Be persistent when you're searching\nfor Pokémon that appear only in\fcertain places.
Are you using fishing rods?\rPokémon that live underwater need to\nbe caught by fishing.
Remember, it's important to make the\nPokémon you've caught evolve.
Pokémon don't just hide in tall grass.\rYou can find many others in caves and\nseas.
The Trainers that challenge you to\nbattle have Pokémon, obviously.\rThey may have rare ones with them,\nand that can add to your Pokédex.
Some Pokémon appear only in the\nmorning and some only at night.\rI know it's a challenge, but I urge you\nto keep searching.
Fantastic! Your effort is helping us\nunderstand what evolving involves.\rYour Pokédex doesn't have long to go\nnow.
I'm simply astounded by the huge\nvariety of Pokémon in Sinnoh.\rThis will help my studies immensely!\nSincerely, thank you!
Your Pokédex is well on the way to\nbeing filled up.\rThis Pokédex can be considered a\njournal of your adventure.
You're not far from seeing every\nPokémon there is to see in Sinnoh!
Oak: Ah, \v0103\x0000\x0000!\rYou've come to show me how\nyour Pokédex is coming along?
Oak: Ah, \v0103\x0000\x0000!\rYou've come to show me how\nyour Pokédex is coming along?
Hmhm...\nYou've caught \v0134\x0000\x0000 so far...\r
I see...\rCome see me if you'd like me to have\na look at your Pokédex.
They say there are at least 400\nspecies of Pokémon nationwide.\rIf you're planning to catch them all,\nyou'd better be a committed Trainer.
Hm! Little by little, you're filling\nthe Pokédex with complete\fdata on Pokémon you've gotten.\rKeep up the good work!
Here's a tip on catching Pokémon\nin the wild.\rMinimize their HP before you throw\nyour Poké Ball to catch them.
Remember: If you can't catch them,\nyou can always trade for them.\rAs soon as you trade, the Pokémon's\ndata is added to the Pokédex.\rThat's why you should seek out as many\ntrades as possible.
Have you visited the Great Marsh?\rSome Pokémon only appear in places\nsuch as that.
As you know, there are Pokémon\nthat eventually evolve.\rThat's an important thing to consider\nwhen you're filling your Pokédex.
You've proven yourself capable.\nThere's nothing to worry about.\rKeep catching Pokémon the way you've\nbeen doing so far.
Are you aware that there is more than\none style of evolution?\rThere are some Pokémon that evolve by\nbecoming friends with the Trainer.
Apparently, there are some Pokémon\nthat appear in swarms on occasion.\rDon't miss out on these massive\noutbreaks of Pokémon!
Amazing! You've already gotten over\n300 Pokémon!\rThat's already a major achievement,\nbut I know you're capable of more!
Some wild Pokémon only appear during\ncertain times of the day.\rYou'll need to look for Pokémon\naround the clock.
I've been getting reports of\ndifferent Pokémon sightings.\rBy different, I mean Pokémon that\naren't native to the Sinnoh region.\rYou should perhaps go back to\nareas you've already scoured.\rYou may end up seeing Pokémon\nthat weren't there before.
\v0103\x0000\x0000, have you visited\nthe Pal Park recently?\rThere still may be Pokémon that are\nrarely seen in Sinnoh.

Hm! Your Pokédex is getting closer\nto completion.\rHave you ever considered a career\nas a Pokémon professor?
Hmm... You've caught quite the\nimpressive collection of Pokémon.\rYou've obviously had to employ many\nmeans to seek them all out.\rIf you have a Poké Radar, keep an eye\nout for rustling tall grass.
I can only marvel at the diversity\nof Pokémon.\rI'm still very much in awe of\nthem.
Good, good, you're getting close to\ncompleting the Pokédex.\rI'm looking forward to seeing its\ncompletion.\rWhen that happens, your views about\nPokémon will likely have changed!
Hmm... You are so very close to\ncompleting your Pokédex.\rThink about what's missing.\nRecall what you've overlooked.\rYou're so close--please finish the\nPokédex!
\v0103\x0000\x0000!\nYou've finally done it!\rYou've finally completed\nthe National Pokédex!\rThis is better than meeting any\nexotic Pokémon for the first time!\rI feel blessed to have become friends\nwith a Trainer like you!\rSincerely, I thank you from the\nbottom of my heart!
