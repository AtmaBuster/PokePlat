Howdy.\nYou're playing the Safari Game?\rHow would you like to try my game out\nat the same time?\rThe rule--yep, there's only one--is\nreal simple.\rAll you have to do is capture five or\nmore Pokémon in one Safari Game.\rIf you can do that, I'll give you the\nPokétch app Matchup Checker.
                                                               
                                                                                                                     
So, how many Pokémon did you catch in\nyour Safari Game? At least five?\rAyup! You've done that all right!\nIsn't that something!\rWell, here you are, then.\nThe Pokétch app Matchup Checker.\r
The Matchup Checker app figures out\nhow Pokémon types match up.\rIt won't help tell us how we match up\nas friends, though.
