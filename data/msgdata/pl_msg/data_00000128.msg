Keira: Oh! My hero!\r
Mom: Oh, hi, \v0103\x0000\x0000.\r
Keira: Wait! No! Really?!\nJohanna is your mom?\fSo you might be a Contest star?!\r
Mom: Oh, I don't know about that.\rI've never spoken to \v0103\x0000\x0000\nabout Contests.\rI'm surprised you two know each\nother, though.\r
Keira: Oh, yes, that's right!\rI need to thank you for earlier.\nPlease take this Accessory.\r
Keira: Put that Accessory on your\nPokémon before a Contest.\rIt will lend a nice touch of\nsophistication and glamour.\rI'm a Contest Judge, so come join us\nfor a different kind of fun.\rIf you're unsure of yourself,\nwe also offer practice sessions.\r
OK, Johanna, I'll see you!\r
Mom: Were you surprised to see me,\n\v0103\x0000\x0000?\rI got bored, so I came out to\nHearthome for a little vacation.\rI'm just as surprised to see you\nhere, my dear!\rBut are you serious about entering\nContests? Not dressed that way!\rWhen your Pokémon is all dressed up,\nyou can't be dressed your usual way.\rPut this on for a little glamour.\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000 obtained\na Tuxedo!
\v0103\x0000\x0000 obtained\na Dress!
Mom: I'm sure it will look good\non you. After all, I chose it.\rGo enjoy the Contests, honey!\rContests will give you a different\nlook at the many charms of Pokémon.\rIt should be an eye-opening\nexperience for you. Bye now!\r
Yes?\nI beg your pardon?\rAh, oui, Contests you are here for?\nI hope very much you enjoy them.\rIncidentally, Fantina, the Gym Leader\nof Hearthome, is also a Contestant.\rShe is, how do you say, très\nfantastique!\rFantina being myself, of course!\rMmm, let me see...\nYou also seem to be très strong.\rEnfin, so it shall be.\nI wait for you at the Gym!\r
You're going to enter Contests?\nBut I don't see a Poffin Case.\rIt could be tough for you to win\nContests without it.\rBut if you're determined to enter,\ndon't let me stop you.\rIt wouldn't hurt to get in some\npractice at the counter on the right.\r
You're going to enter Contests?\nAnd, yup, you have a Poffin Case.\rLet me gift you with this fabulously\nwonderful Poffin!\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000 received\na Mild Poffin!
The Mild Poffin was put away\nin the Poffin Case.\r
Feed that Poffin to a Pokémon you're\ngoing to enter in Contests.\rOh, and a word of advice.\nGo take a run at the Contests!\rThe best way to get ready is to\nget some practice first.\rYou can take practice sessions at\nthe counter on the right.\r

Like everything else, the basics are\nimportant.\rIt takes practice to win Contests!
Oh, no.\nYour Poffin Case's full.
Oh, no.\nYour Poffin Case is full.\fI'll give it to you another time.\rOh, and a word of advice.\nGo take a run at the Contests!\r...That isn't much of a strategy.\nYou might want some practice first.\rYou can take practice sessions at\nthe counter on the right.\r
A Pokémon fed Poffins does\nbetter in Visual Evaluations.\rI'd better learn how to cook\ndelicious Poffins at the Poffin House!
A Contest has three parts: Visual!\nDance! And Acting!\rThe Contestants get graded in those\ncategories, dohoho!
They put up photos of the winners!
