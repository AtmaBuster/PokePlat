I've been hiking all around the\nSinnoh region.\rI love planting Berries wherever\nI go.\rI'll give you a Berry, too.\nPlease plant it somewhere.\r
Planting Berries is good for Pok√©mon.\rIt provides them with more things to\neat in the wild.
My sister gathers Berries every day!\nPlease come visit again!\rWe cook the Berries, too!\nWe mix them up! They're yummy!
