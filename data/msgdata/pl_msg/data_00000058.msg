H-hello!\nThis is the Canalave Library.\rPlease keep quiet while you're on\nthe premises.\rIt certainly wasn't me who screamed,\r\vff01\x00c8“Gyaaah!!”\vff01\x0064\r\vff01\x00c8\vff01\x0064or shouted,\r\vff01\x00c8“Help meee!!”\vff01\x0064\r\vff01\x00c8\vff01\x0064No, really, that wasn't me\nscreaming!
...\r
What is it? Please don't disturb\nme when I'm reading.\r
I've been asking people not to\ndisturb me while I'm reading...\rI shouldn't even have bothered...\nI'm all agitated now!
The ceiling-high bookshelves are\ncrammed with books.
The shelves are lined with books\nworn from being read by many people.
Lucian: ...Ah, hello.\nYou're here to read, too?\rBooks are wonderful things.\rThe thoughts of people written in books\nstretch beyond time and space.\r
I imagine we'll see each other again\nat the Pokémon League. Take care.\r
I was just reading a collection of\nletters written by an artist long ago.\rMore precisely, they were written to\nthe artist's younger brother.\r“The stars above tantalize from\nacross infinite space.\r“Feeling their gaze from so far away,\nI am charmed again by life.”\rThe artist must have come to a\nconclusion seeing the night sky...\rIt's an affirmation of life.\nIt's very moving.\r
I was just reading an analytical tome on\nhumankind.\rIt examines the human species from\ncultural and social perspectives.\rThis is a thought-provoking quote: \n“It all began without humans.\fThe end will also be without humans.”\rThe world we share with Pokémon...\nDoes it exist for us?\r
I was just reading a collection of\nobservations on Pokémon in the wild.\rOne article addresses the question why\nPokémon would go into a Poké Ball.\rAccording to the article, this behavior\nis based on instinct.\rA weakened Pokémon will curl up tight\nin an effort to heal itself.\rThe Poké Ball was invented to take\nadvantage of that protective instinct.\r
I was just reading a collection of\nessays on the science-fiction genre.\rThere was one quote attributed to a\nnovelist I found remarkable.\r“Though love may lose, kindness wins.”\rI find that philosophical and, at the\nsame time, compassionate.\r
I was just reading a book of philosophy\nfrom an ancient, far-off land.\rTheir “universe” was a word that\ndescribed both space and time.\rThat people even back then understood\nthe basic tenets of the universe...\rIt fills me with a serene sense of\ninspiration.\r
