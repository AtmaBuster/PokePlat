Hohoho...\nThey call me Grandma Wilma.\rI came out here by myself from\na town of Dragon Tamers.\rI can teach the strongest of all\nDragon-type moves to the tough\fPokémon of Sinnoh.\rWould you like me to teach that\nmove to one of your Pokémon?
Ah, it is you again...\rWould you like me to teach the best\nDragon-type move I know to one of\fyour Pokémon?
Well, perhaps if you change your\nmind, do come back.
I see...\nI like your sense of adventure.\rHowever, none of the Pokémon with\nyou now can learn the move.
Fine, fine, now pick the Pokémon\nI should teach the move to.\r
Sorry to disappoint you...\rThat Pokémon you have can learn this\nmove, but it hasn't come to trust\fyou fully yet...\rUntil then, I can't make it learn\nthis move.
Sorry to disappoint you...\nThat Pokémon can't learn this move.
Hmmmm...\rTeaching a move to an Egg is\na challenge that's beyond me.
Oh? That Pokémon already knows\n\v0106\x0000\x0000.
                            
                         
                                                                                        
                             
                         
                      
                                                                            
Draco Meteor's destructive power\nis awe inspiring.\rHowever, using it will also lower\nthe Pokémon's Special Attack.
