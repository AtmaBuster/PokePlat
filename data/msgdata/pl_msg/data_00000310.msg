They're very helpful here.\rThe staff tell you about the next\nTrainer you'll face.
Want to hear my trick to choosing\nPokémon?\rGet your opponent's lineup and choose\naccordingly. That's rock-solid basic!
Memorize what moves the opponent's\nPokémon used.\rThat way, you'll know what to expect\nwhen you're choosing one for trade.
I'll teach you my style.\nMy way of doing things.\rBasically, I choose Pokémon that I've\nnever raised before.\rDoing that, I get more knowledgeable.\nBetter Pokémon intelligence.\rThat knowledge is power.\nIt makes me a better Trainer.
Howdy-do!\nDo you raise Pokémon?\rYou sure do.\nOf course you do.\rBut do you raise every kind of Pokémon?\nNo, no, no. Not likely you do.\rThis is a wonderful place.\nYou can challenge with nothing.\rOf course, all you can challenge with\nare rental Pokémon.\rRemember this, my favorite place to be.\nIts name: the Battle Factory!
Oh, my goodness, what am I to do?\nI didn't expect this to happen!\rThe Pokémon I battled with became my\nfavorites.\rBut I already have six favorites!
There were some Pokémon I hated\nbecause they were so tough to battle.\rBut when I had them on my side, they\nwon me over with their power.
