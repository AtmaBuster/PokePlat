Hey, \v0103\x0001\x0000.\nYou can choose first. Go ahead.\rYou know, like, I'm gonna be a man\nabout it. Yeah, I'm slick.
\v0103\x0000\x0000: That Pokémon battle...\rWasn't that wickedly fun or what?\rI mean, I'd pick the moves, and my\nPokémon would use them!\rYeah, I'm going to battle tons and get\nreal close with Pokémon.
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Pokémon all have\ndifferent moves, huh?\rA Trainer makes his Pokémon battle\nby ordering them to use moves.\rThat's so awesomely cool.
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Do you believe it?\nI can hardly believe it.\rYou and me, we're Pokémon Trainers all\nof a sudden.\rMan, we've got tons to learn about\nbeing a Trainer.\rBut seeing this Poké Ball with this\n\v0100\x0001\x0000 inside...\rIt makes me feel like I can do anything!\nNothing's impossible!
\v0103\x0000\x0000: That lake has a mirage\nPokémon living in it.\rEveryone says it's just a legend, but\nI know I'm right.
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Hey, do you know about\nthe Champion?\rThere's this out-of-this-world tough\nTrainer who gets called that.\rWell, I'm gonna get so tough, the Champ\nhas to battle me. You watch!\rWith this little guy here, I'm sure I can\nget that tough.
\v0103\x0000\x0000: Hey, that's enough\ntalking already.\rI'm itching to get going to the lake.\nCome on, come on!
\v0103\x0000\x0000: All right!\nLet's move out! Hustle up!
                                                          
                                                        
                                                
Cheryl: It's startling to see two wild\nPokémon appearing at the same time.
Cheryl: My Pokémon is an excellent\nhealer.\rBut attacking isn't its strong point.
Cheryl: \v0103\x0000\x0000, battling with\nyou makes me feel elated.\rIf I could predict what you're about\nto do, we would make a fierce combo!
Cheryl: That's some nice moss...
Mira: Are you going to use that?\nI will be left all alone...
Mira: Are you going to use that?\nI will be left all alone...
Mira: That isn't the right way.\nI'll be lost if we go down...
Mira: I like helpful Pokémon moves\nlike Growl and Minimize.\rThose kinds of moves are my\nfavorites.
Mira: This cave...\nIt's so easy to get confused here.\fDo you know where we are?
Mira: \v0103\x0000\x0000, did you get to be\nso good because you're always with\fyour Pokémon?\rYes! That has to be it!\nI will try like you!
Riley: If you use that, I'll have to\nwave good-bye to you now.
Riley: If you use that move, I'll have\nto wave good-bye to you now.
Riley: Haha, I'd have to agree.\rPeople training here would be those\nwith too much time on their hands.
Riley: This used to be a fairly\nthriving ore mine once upon a time.\rI guess the steel ore's played out.\nThere's only Pokémon here now.
Riley: Have you met Byron?\nThe Leader of Canalave Gym?\rHe's asked me to become a Gym\nLeader, but there's his son Roark\fto consider as well.
Riley: Imagine what it would be like\nfor a Steel-type Pokémon user to\fbattle a Steel type.\rWould that be like battling yourself,\nI wonder?\rI mean, it's a lot harder to defeat\none's self than anyone else.
Riley: What's going on here, though?\nThe native Pokémon are restless...\rI don't like this...\nLet's hurry.
Riley: Thanks.\nYou really helped me out.\rListen, I have a Pokémon here\nnamed Luca.\rWould you take it with you?\r
Riley: Thanks!\rI want you to show Luca all sorts\nof worlds.\r
Riley: Thank you...\rBut you don't have room to take\nanother Pokémon.\rAll right, then.\nI'll wait here for you.
Riley: I hope you'll accept it as\na token of our friendship.
Riley: Spending time with you was\nvery enjoyable.\rI intend to test my skills in other\nplaces from now on.\rIt would be great if we could meet\nagain.\r
Marley: ...Are you going to leave\nme here?
Marley: ...Are you going to leave\nme here?
Marley: ...Sorry, but I'm not\ngoing up.
Marley: ...It isn't that way.
Marley: ...You're very chatty...
Marley: ...The Pokémon among\nflowers...
Buck: Whoa, \v0103\x0000\x0000!\rIf you use that, me and my Pokémon\nwill be left behind. Don't do it!
Buck: Whoa, \v0103\x0000\x0000!\rIf you use that, me and my Pokémon\nwill be left behind. Don't do it!
Buck: This is where I raised my Pokémon.\rI can't stand the thought of anyone\nmaking a mess of this place.\rEspecially not those weird Team\nGalactic goons!
Buck: There's no law that says\nI have to be tough or anything,\fbut losing isn't fair to my Pokémon.\rAfter all, they try so hard for me.\rI think it's my responsibility as a\nTrainer to recognize their hard work.
Buck: My big brother's one of the\nElite Four.\rSo, of course it's only normal that\nI'd be better than ordinary folks.\rBut that's not what I want.\nI want to be tough on my own terms.\rIt wouldn't be fair to the Pokémon\nthat chose to be with me.
Buck: It might be cool being a Gym\nLeader or one of the Elite Four...\rBut, then again, it sounds like it'd\nbe a lot of hard work!
