Sneaking a peek at other people's PC\nBoxes fills me with guilty glee.\rBut it's a secret sort of pleasure I'd\nrather not have others know about.\r...Ignoring the fact that me being here\nis a surefire giveaway.
Did you know?\nAbout my PC Box, I mean.\rIt's full of Pokémon everyone longs\nfor, like...\r...No, it would be immodest for me to\nsay. It would sound like bragging.\rIf you really must know, you can always\nfind out yourself.
I visit every day to check on other\npeople's Dress-Up Data.\rFor me, it's like the first step to\nfashion!
Oh, dear me! Gracious!\nThis is almost scandalous!

I got a Backdrop from a nice lady\ndownstairs. For free!
What I like to do...\rI like sneaking glances at the people\nchecking out Dress-Up Data.
