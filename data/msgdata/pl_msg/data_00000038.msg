Pokémon are wonderful, deeply\nmysterious creatures.\rBut to Trainers, the key thing is to do\nbattle with their Pokémon.\rThat's what it boils down to.
Hello there, Trainer!\rIf you get stumped and don't know\nwhat to do...\rTalk to people!\nTalk to everyone you see!\rGo places!\nGo wherever you can!\rYou'll find many new places by\ndoing just that.
