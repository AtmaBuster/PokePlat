You know how you can catch Pokémon\nin the trophy garden?\rIf you put this on a caught Pokémon,\nit warms up to you faster.\rI'll share one with you, so give it\na try.\r
I hope you become a Trainer that\nPokémon can love and trust.
I'm not loafing.\nI'm just taking a personal break.\rIt's my official policy to sleep in a bed\nwhen I'm officially loafing.
It's a bed...\nWant to take a rest?
\v0103\x0000\x0000 quickly fell asleep in\nthe bed...\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000 and the Pokémon became\nfully healed from the nap!
