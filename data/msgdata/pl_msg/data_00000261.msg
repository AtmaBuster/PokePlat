Grunt 1: This is it!\nStark Mountain!\rNow we need to get deep inside.\nLet's do this!\r
Grunt 2: Yeah, but...\nCan that old guy really take over?\fCan he replace Master Cyrus?\r
Grunt 1: Yeah, I hear you...\rThat elder Charon is a Commander,\nbut he can't replace Master Cyrus.\r...Maybe this is a good time for me to\nbe done with this Team Galactic thing...\r
Looker: Whew! The air outside, it is\ndelicious, yes!\r...Gweh! Gah! Geff! Bleah!\rI have inhaled the volcanic ash by\nthe lungful!\r
Now, you two.\nThis is what they were after.\rThe Magma Stone.\rMoving this is said to awaken the\nPokémon HEATRAN.\rThe old tales say that its awakening,\nit will make Stark Mountain erupt.\r...But I have moved it. It is here.\nWill this cause the eruption?!\r
Buck: Hey, don't sweat it, stranger.\rGive me that Magma Stone.\nI'll go put it back for you.\r
Looker: That boy, he has quite the\nenergy, yes?\r\v0103\x0000\x0000, I should tell you why\nI have arrived here.\rAfter we parted at the Mt. Coronet,\nI investigated their hideout.\rI uncovered Charon's plot, which led\nme to a stakeout of this place.\rThat Charon is now securely within our\ncustody.\rIt is safe to say the Team Galactic is\na threat no longer.\rThat being said, it looks like my work\nhere is finally finished.\r
Buck: Hey, stranger!\nI put the Magma Stone where it belongs.\rIt'll be OK now.\nHEATRAN won't wake up. Probably.\rBut, hey, \v0103\x0000\x0000!\nYou're an amazing Trainer!\rSwing by my place later.\nIt's in the Survival Area.\rBe seeing you, stranger, \v0103\x0000\x0000!\nBye-bye!\r
Looker: I, also, will take my leave.\r“The more wonderful the meeting, the\nsadder the parting.”\rThat is a quote I have heard many years\nago in a foreign land.\rIts meaning...\nI understand it better now.\rFarewell, \v0103\x0000\x0000, my friend!\nLong may you cherish Pokémon!\r
