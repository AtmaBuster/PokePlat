What items should Pokémon hold?\nIt's an important question.\rHere's something else to think about.\r
Should one enhance a Pokémon's strong\npoint?\rOr cover for a weakness instead?\rIt's a dilemma that comes up every time\nI let a Pokémon hold an item.
An item that guarantees you won't\never lose a battle...\rThey don't sell anything like that.
