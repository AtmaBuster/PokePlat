The Contests are interesting, but the\nruins of Solaceon Town are as well...
Sorry, the gate's closed for a while.\nWe're on location for a TV shoot.
I traveled a long way to take part\nin these Contests.
                                                                                                
I've given my Pokémon lots of Poffins.\rI'm confident that we'll win our share\nof Contests.
There's a Day Care in Solaceon Town\nthat raises Pokémon for you.
