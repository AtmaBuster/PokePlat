There are eight Gym Leaders in the\nSinnoh region.\rThe objective for Trainers is to get\nGym Badges from them all.\rThat means you have to defeat all of\nthem in battles at their Gyms!
A Gym Leader isn't like just any Trainer\nyou meet.\rObviously, they're a lot tougher.\nA lot.\rI'd take as many Pokémon as possible\nif I were you.
Roark lets us train our Pokémon in\nthe mine.
