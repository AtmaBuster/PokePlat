Mr. Backlot in the Pokémon Mansion \nlooks forward to seeing visitors.\rHe must be able to wait around because\nhe wants to brag about something.
There are good trees that you can\nsmear with Honey, and some you can't.\rIf you want to lure rare Pokémon,\nyou have to find an attractive tree.
Why, hello there!\rIt's nice to have an average citizen\nsay hi to us Policemen!
Patrols day and night...\nI'm feeling drowsy... Yawn...
Yo!\nWorking hard at it, Trainer?
Just between you and me...\nI think we're on patrol too much.
