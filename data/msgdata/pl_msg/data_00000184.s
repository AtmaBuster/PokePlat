\v0103\x0000\x0000: I guess I'm not ready\nfor the Pokémon League if I'm losing\fto you!\rDarn it!\nYou watch, though!\rI'll get tougher and win my way\nthrough the Pokémon League!\rBecause I'm going to become the\nChampion, the toughest Trainer!\r\v0103\x0001\x0000!

Very well!\rTrainer, you've indeed collected\nall the Gym Badges of Sinnoh!\rDemonstrate the power that brought\nyou here and go for glory!
You will be facing the Elite Four\nof the Pokémon League.\rIf you can't beat all four of them\nin a row, you have to start from\fthe first one again.
It doesn't matter if the going is slow.\rNor does it matter how many challenges\nit takes.\rI'm never giving up!\nNot until I beat the Elite Four!
