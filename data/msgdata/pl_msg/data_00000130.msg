And there do I see my father.\nMy son. My life.\rAnd there do I see nature.\nPokémon. The world.
The art of crafting things fatigues\none's spirit.\rWhen the spirit is healed, the desire\nto make something returns.\rIt is such a wondrous cycle.
When people and Pokémon join hands,\neveryone's happy.\rIt makes everyone come together.\nIt could even make the world one!
That people are lonely is only natural.\nIt gives me compassion for others.\rIt's what makes me look forward to\na better tomorrow.\rBut there are still moments of\nfondness for the past.\fThough, time can heal some sadness...
There are still words that not everyone\ncan describe...\fThe words are “love” and “joy.”
Pokémon... People... It's only natural\nthat we are all so very different.\rMake sure that you never judge\na Pokémon on if it's weak or strong.\rYou must always look for the good\ninside of them. That's what counts!
If the strong and able do too much,\nthey limit the contributions of others.\rThe strong must show restraint.\rThis enables everyone to live together\nand share responsibility.
We cannot read the minds of others,\nwhich causes us to feel fear and doubt.\rBut to control the aspects of the world\nbeyond our senses is an impossibility.\n
Mind and matter.\rIt's no good if one is stronger than\nthe other.\rBalance is what's needed.\nThat's the key.
