I've traveled a long way to make my\nbeloved Pokémon even more beautiful.\rThat will make it love me even more.\nGiggle!
Nothing is too good for my Pokémon.\nThere's no mountain too high to climb.\fThat's how I look at it.
Oh, how I long to become a member of\nthe Ribbon Syndicate.\rMy dearest Pokémon will be treated to\ndreamy experiences!
A member of the Ribbon Syndicate?\nYou are? Really?\rHow did you manage to collect so many\nPokémon Ribbons?
You know how you can dig up cool\nstuff in the Underground?\rPeople are saying they're digging up\nnew, different stuff.
Nobody believes me, but something\nlurks in the Resort Area.\rIt's the hidden ruler of the area!\nYou have to believe me!\rIf you believe me, whip out your\nSuper Rod and go fishing.\rWho knows, you may just catch the\nmind-blowing ruler!
Psst, hey, traveler! Yes, you!\nI want you to have this Villa!\rOh, wait, no, no, no!\nIt's not what you're thinking!\rThis is no scam, see.\nIn fact, you'll be doing me a favor!\rSee, I was given this Villa. But, to\nbe honest, I don't need it, either.\rSo don't say a word.\nJust nod and this Villa is yours!
Whew, that's a load off my mind.\rThe original owner was from Hoenn,\nsee?\rThe owner collected up all the rare\nstones of Sinnoh and went back home.\rI somehow got saddled with this place\nas if it were some gift.\rThere's no figuring what rich folks\nwill think of next.\rStill, I thank you for helping me out.\nCome with me, will you?\r
What, I still strike you as shady?\nI daresay I can't blame you, though.\rAn offer to get a Villa for free...\nThat does throw up red flags, I agree.\r
None too shabby, you have to agree.\nStep inside for a look-see.\r
Rowan: Hm! I happened to be in the\narea on a small errand.\fI'd like to take a rest if you'd allow it.
Rowan: Hm!\nI appreciate your hospitality.\r
Rowan: Hmm...\nDo you have something to hide?
Roark: Hi! Could I take a peek inside\nyour Villa?
Roark: Thanks!\r
Roark: ...Oh, sorry.\nAm I intruding on something?
Gardenia: Listen, listen!\nI came for a visit! Can I go in?
Gardenia: Yes!\nNo time to waste!\r
Gardenia: Oh, right.\nYou must have plans already.
Maylene: ...Um, your Villa...\nWould it be OK if I took a look around?
Maylene: Oh, thank you.\r
Maylene: Oh...\nIt makes me a little sad...
Byron: Guhahahaha!\rHow's your Villa?\nCan you give me a tour?
Byron: All right!\nLet's have a look, then!\r
Byron: Well!\nHow cold can you be?
