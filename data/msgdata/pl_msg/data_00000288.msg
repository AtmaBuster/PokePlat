You... You came all the way here\njust to save some Pokémon?\r...Though it's nothing new, I can't\nsay I understand our boss...\rWhy would he let a kid like you\ncome and go freely...?\rWe, Team Galactic, take all that we\nneed, and eliminate what we do not.\rBut anyway. You've taken the trouble\nto come. Let me welcome you!\rConsider it payback for your insulting\nme at the lake.\r
...Gah!\nWhat makes you so tough?\rFine... Do whatever you want with\nthose three Pokémon.\rPress the button on that machine\nto set them free.\r
Press the button and set them free.\nIsn't that why you came?
Our boss crafted a Red Chain from\ncrystals he took from the three\fPokémon.\rThat Red Chain is what he needed to\nshackle something on Mt. Coronet.\rIt's also apparently needed for\ncreating something.\rBut that's all I know. Who knows\nwhat he's planning to do up there.\r
Press the button and set them free.\nIsn't that why you came?\r
Charon: Fuhyahya!\rThose Pokémon of the lakes, where do\nyou suppose they would go?\r
Saturn: What are you trying to say?\r
Charon: Nothing.\nPay it no heed.\rA new world isn't overly interesting.\nWhat of it?\rIf Cyrus is right, then Team Galactic\nwill rule that new world.\rThat's when it will be interesting.\nA chance to enjoy its sweets.\rI surely hope that our visionary Cyrus\nrealizes his dream.\rI look forward to whatever our beloved\nleader has planned atop Mt. Coronet.\r
Saturn: Gramps.\rOur boss can do without your kind of\nmoral support.
Charon: Humph. Saturn and even Cyrus\nfall to a mere child...\rTeam Galactic's state of affairs is\nworrying...\rThat plan of Cyrus's atop Mt. Coronet,\ntoo... Who knows if it will work.\r...Hmm. Perhaps another option needs\nto be considered.\rOne befitting the genius of Charon!
