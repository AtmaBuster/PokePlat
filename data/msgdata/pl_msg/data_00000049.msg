\v0103\x0001\x0000: Hey, \v0103\x0000\x0000!\nDid you come to study, too?\rI went ahead and memorized everything\nthat was up on the blackboard.\rAfter all, it's the Trainer's job to\navoid having their precious Pokémon\fhurt in battle, right?\rSo, \v0103\x0000\x0000, what brings you?\nHuh?\fYou've got something for me?\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000 delivered the Parcel.
\v0103\x0001\x0000: So, what is this...?\rScore!\nIt's a Town Map!\rHuh?!\nWhy are there two in here?\rI like it a lot, but I don't need two.\nHere, \v0103\x0000\x0000, you take one!\r
\v0103\x0001\x0000: Hmm...\rWell, according to the Town Map,\nI guess Oreburgh City is where\fI should be going next.\rThere's a Gym, so it'd be perfect for\nraising the Pokémon I just caught.\rWell, I'm on the road to becoming\nthe greatest Trainer of all time!\rSee you around!\r
It's perfectly fine for Trainers and\nPokémon to develop at their own pace.\rIf there is anything you're not familiar\nwith, you can look it up here.
                             
We learned about Pokémon types\ntoday. Umm...\rGrass is weak to Fire,\rFire is weak to Water,\rand Water is weak to Grass!
Pokémon are smart enough to use\nitems they're holding.\rBut they won't know what to do with\nman-made items like Potions and\fAntidotes.
I wrote an essay in my notebook on \nwhat makes a true Pokémon Trainer.
Doing it is the best way to learn!\nCan we get a battle with you?
Go!\nMy Pokémon, go!\r
Aww! But battling is the best way\nto learn about Pokémon!
It's hard to win if you don't have\nsome Pokémon to choose from.
Whew! You're really good!\rWe've been studying every day, but\nwe were no match for you at all!\rYou'd be able to use this Potion\nproperly. Here you go!\r
When a Potion is used, it restores the\nHP, the health, of a Pokémon.\rBeing a good Trainer isn't only about\nordering your Pokémon around.\rA superior Trainer knows how to use\nitems to the full advantage!
I just became friends with my\nPokémon.\rI'm not sure if we can do this\nproperly, but may we battle?
I need to try the things I learned\nbefore I forget them!\r
Boo!\nWhere's your sense of adventure?\rDon't be shy about talking to people\nand getting into battles!
I wonder if we could have done better\nagainst you?\rLike if I used Potions right when we\nneeded to.
We were actually confident that we\nwould do pretty good.\rBut I'm completely impressed by how\ntough you are.\rIf you'd like, talk to my friend and\nget a nice item from him.
The blackboard lists status changes\nthat may affect Pokémon in battle.\r
Which would you like to read about?
If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will\nsteadily lose HP.\rThe effects of poison remain after\na battle.\rA poisoned Pokémon's HP will drop\nwhile it is traveling.\rHeal a poisoning using an Antidote.\r
If a Pokémon becomes paralyzed,\nits Speed stat drops.\rIn addition, it may not be able to\nmove while it is in battle.\rParalysis remains after battle.\nCure it using a Parlyz Heal.\r
If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be\nunable to attack.\rThe Pokémon may wake up on its own,\nbut if a battle ends while it is\fsleeping, it will stay asleep.\rWake it up using an Awakening.\r
A burn reduces the Attack stat and\nsteadily reduces the victim's HP.\rA burn lingers after battle.\nCure a burn using a Burn Heal.\r
If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes\ncompletely helpless.\rThe Pokémon may thaw out on its own,\nbut if a battle ends while it is\ffrozen, it will stay frozen.\rThaw it out using an Ice Heal.\r
It's a notebook filled with writing.\nLet's see...\rPokémon are to be caught using\nPoké Balls.\rUp to six Pokémon can accompany\na Trainer.\rA Trainer is someone who catches\nPokémon, raises them, and battles\fwith them.\rA Trainer's mission is to defeat the\nstrong Trainers who await challengers\fin Pokémon Gyms.
