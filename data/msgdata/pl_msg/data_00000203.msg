Hi, can we feature you in a news piece\nwe're doing?\rAll you have to do is battle with me.\nWill you do that?
Reporter Kinsey's live interview!\r
Unbelievable! Press coverage denied!\nI find you intriguing, too...
To get people to open up, we approach\nthem honestly with no hidden tricks.\rIt's like the relationship between\nPokémon and Trainers, isn't it?
I've spotted a charismatic Trainer!\nIs it OK to go for the scoop?
As a professional cameraman, I always\ngo for the best shot!\r
That's a downer...\rI thought I'd found a Trainer and\nPokémon who'd shine on camera.
The lively expressions on you and your\nPokémon's faces...\rIt sure makes for some great TV!
Are we all ready to have some fun?\nI sure am! Aren't you having fun?!\fLet's make it fun! OK?!
OK, how shall we do this?\nShall we do something fantastical?\r
Oh, how shall I say this...?\nIt makes me all lonely, I say...
A clown's makeup is a face that's\ncrying while laughing. Mwahahah!\rIt defines what we do!
Come on, let's show off our Pokémon!\nLet's do battle, kiddo!
Your spirit's vibes...\nYou've got rock in your veins!\r
My guitar...\nIt lies broken and weeping...
Pokémon and rock and roll are all\nanyone needs to survive this world!
Hi, I'm Grace, the Idol! I'm just back\nfrom a show in Oreburgh Mine!\rSo, shall we battle?
I'll let you join my fan club if you can\nbeat me!\r
You won't accept my challenge?!\nBut I'm an Idol...
Well, that's me and my Pokémon!\nI hope you'll support us!\rJust so you know, our latest single is\ntitled “Jigglin' Pokémon Wub”!
Two Pokémon!\nThat's what we need.\rWe're looking for a Trainer who's\ntraveling with at least two Pokémon.
Oh! Would you like to battle against the\nboth of us?
You're live on camera, but try to act\nnatural, OK?\r
OK, that's how it is, huh.\nCan't do anything about that.
Whee!\nWasn't that battle smoking hot?\rYou should make a Battle Video of it and\nshare it with the world!
Oh, dear!\nYou only have one Pokémon with you?\rThat's very commendable, but we can't\nbattle with you that way.
Giggle!\nCould you win against both of us?
We'll thoroughly check out your\nabilities as a Trainer!\r
Oh? You haven't healed your Pokémon,\nmaybe?
That was a good match.\rIt adds flair and drama when many\neager Pokémon get involved.
We're doing a news piece on Trainers.\nCan we get you to participate?\rIf we can, we'd like to see how strong\nyou are in a battle!
Jubilife TV!\nOn-the-spot live report!\r
...Are you one of those contrary\npeople who reply “No” first thing?
Why Trainers choose certain kinds of\nPokémon and their feelings about it...\rThat's what we're investigating.
I felt a flash of inspiration when I laid\neyes on you.\rI'd really love to capture you on\ncamera while you're battling.
For close-ups, I need to get in tight.\nYou don't mind, do you?\r
That's a downer...\rI thought I'd found a Trainer and\nPokémon who'd shine on camera.
So, did you come to Hearthome to\ncompete in Contests?
Would you like to battle with me?\nAs a memento of your visit to Pastoria?
I'll let you join my fan club if you can\nbeat me!\r
You're not interested in Idols?\n...I think I'm going to cry.
Well, that's me and my Pokémon!\nI hope you'll support us!\rJust so you know, our latest single is\ntitled “Jigglin' Pokémon Wub”!
Are we all ready to have some fun?\nOur battle will be fun! OK?!
OK, how shall we do this?\nShall we do something fantastical?\r
Oh, how shall I say this...?\nIt makes me all lonely, I say...
Well, let's see!\nWhich town will we go to next?
Come on, let's show off our Pokémon!\nLet's do battle, kiddo!
Your spirit's vibes...\nYou've got rock in your veins!\r
My guitar...\nIt lies broken and weeping...
Rock is about your spirit!\nBattling is about spirit, too!\fThat's why a battle is rock!
Two Pokémon! If you had two Pokémon,\nwe'd get a great shot here.
Oh! You're ready for a battle\nwith us?
You're live on camera, but try to act\nnatural, OK?\r
OK, that's how it is, huh.\nCan't do anything about that.
I'd like to take that footage and\nbroadcast it worldwide.
Oh, no. What we really want to see\nis you battling using two Pokémon!
Giggle!\nWill you have a battle with us?
We'll thoroughly check out your\nabilities as a Trainer!\r
Oh, too bad!\nI wanted to check out your Pokémon!
I lost but I'm totally thrilled!\nWe made a wonderful spectacle!
Do you want to hear me play my guitar?\nOr do we battle?
Your spirit's vibes...\nYou've got rock in your veins!\r
My guitar...\nIt lies broken and weeping...
For Trainers, Pokémon!\rFor my girl, sweet kisses!\rThat's the perfect world for this\nguitarist!
Thank you for coming to Grace's live\nshow in Snowpoint!\rI'm so happy you came to see me!\nI'll battle you as my thank-you!
I'll let you join my fan club if you can\nbeat me!\r
But my song!\nIt's nicer than that Crasher Wake's!
My dream is to be the top Idol!\rTo win everyone's heart, I'll sing my\nheart out in snowy Snowpoint!\r...To a crowd of none.\n...This is Grace. Thanks for listening...
We're doing a feature on tough Trainers\nin the Battle Zone.\rThat's where you come in.\nWe need you to battle us!
Reporter Kinsey's live interview!\r
You don't have to be shy.\nWe can obscure your face if we have to.
I go after interviews like my favorite\nPokémon move--I tackle them!\rOf course, I don't use Tackle in\nbattles, though.
Expert Trainer spotted!\nWill you let us battle with you?
Great! Great!\nYou guys are great!\r
Want to see how good you are before\nyou go off to the Battle Frontier?
The combination of you and your Pokémon\nwill tear up the Battle Tower!
Po-Po-Pokémon!\rI want to become more like a PIKACHU!\nWill you battle me?
Pi-Pikachu!\r
Pi-Pikachu!
I can make static electricity, but I'm\nnot very much like a Pokémon yet.\rDon't give up, me!\nBecome a Pokémon, me!
Pikachu!\rI want to become more like a PIKACHU!\nWill you battle me?
Pi-Pikachu!\r
Pi-Pikachu!
I need to find a way to get more into\nthe character of a Pokémon...\rMaybe I should get the Day Care to\nraise me?
As a clown, I like to show off Pokémon\nthat are a little out of the ordinary.\rWant to battle and see for yourself?
OK, how shall we do this?\nShall we do something fantastical?\r
Oh, how shall I say this...?\nIt makes me all lonely, I say...
Here's a piece of useless trivia.\nFear of clowns is also known as\fcoulrophobia!
Po-Po-Pokémon!\rI want to become more like a PIKACHU!\nWill you battle me?
Pi-Pikachu!\r
Pi-Pikachu!
But I just had my team pampered at the\nRibbon Syndicate!\rI have to get more into the character\nof a Pokémon...
