There's an odd spaceman\nin front of the ruins.\rThere isn't anything there, but that\nonly seemed to make him get angry.\rHe's saying he will blow the town\nup with a bomb...\rThe nerve of it all...\rIf only I were younger, I'd punish\nthat spaceman with my Pokémon...
This town is insignificant!\nThere's nothing of value here.\rIt doesn't need to exist, so I'll\nblow it up with a Galactic Bomb!\rIf you try to mess with me, I'll shut\nyou down with a Pokémon battle.\rSo, what's it going to be?\nAre you going to mess with me?
You dare to oppose Team Galactic?\rThat means you're taking on the\nworld... No, the universe, even!\r
That's right! Very smart!\nYou know what's good for you!\rTeam Galactic has come out to the\nboonies like this for everyone's sake.\rYour cooperation is appreciated.\nNow, where is my partner...?
Too much to handle...\nI can't do anything here...\rThis place is nothing!\nI'll be happily rid of this place!\r
Oh, you were magnificent!\nAren't you quite the Trainer?\rAs the elder of Celestic Town, I give\nyou my thanks.\rOh? That Old Charm...\nMay I see that, dear?\r...\nWhat's that?\rYou say Cynthia entrusted you with\nit to deliver to me?\rThat Cynthia...\nShe's my granddaughter.\r
\v0103\x0000\x0000 handed over\nthe \v0108\x0001\x0000 to the elder.
This Old Charm is something made in\nCelestic Town long, long ago.\rIt was made in honor of a mythical\ndeity said to have created Sinnoh.\rThese Old Charms are still discovered\nnow and again.\rSince you're in Celestic Town, why not\nlook around inside the ruins?
You've gone to the trouble of visiting\nCelestic Town.\rWhy not take a little more time to\nexamine the ruins?
Cynthia: Was everything all right here?\rYou saw those strange people with\na Galactic Bomb, didn't you?\r
But those Team Galactic people...!\nI thought they were harmless.\rThe bizarre ways they dress, and all\ntheir wild claims about making a new\funiverse...\rI thought it was just silly talk.\nNothing to take seriously.\rBut they're surprisingly more trouble\nthan expected.\rTrying to monopolize Pokémon just isn't\nacceptable!\r
By the way, were the ruins fun to\nexplore?\rIf you're interested, there is a library\nin Canalave City.\rIt's stocked with ancient books.\nYou can look up Sinnoh history there.\rIt might help you complete your\nPokédex, too.\rThe quickest way to Canalave City\nis to go west from Jubilife City.
Howdy!\nStudying up on local history?
Hey, do you know what they say?\rThey say a Pokémon created the\nSinnoh region.
There's no Pokémon Mart in this\ntown...\rInstead, you can buy and sell items\nin this house here.

A giant etching of a Pokémon-like\ncreature covers the wall...\rThere is some fading text etched\nin as well...\rThe flow of time never stops...\nThe past, future, and present...
A giant etching of a Pokémon-like\ncreature covers the wall...\rThere is some fading text etched\nin as well...\rSpace is ever-expanding dimensions...\nOur spirits, too, are as space...
