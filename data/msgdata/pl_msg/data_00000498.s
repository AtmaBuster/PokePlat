Ah, hello. You wish to stay a night?\nAh, but you've no reservations.\rI'm afraid we are totally booked.\nYou may rest a while, if you wish.\r
We've restored your Pokémon\nto full health.\rWe hope to see you again!
This hotel is so romantic...\rI hope a knight on a Pokémon will\nsweep me away for a honeymoon here!
Looker: Ah, my friend, it is you!\nYes, I am at this hotel now.\rI am interviewing the people to see \nif they have seen anyone suspicious.\rI would like your assistance.\nGo search outside, if you will.\rThe suspect, he may have already\nslipped away ahead unnoticed.
Looker: Is that so?\nThe champion of Hoenn has stayed here?\rBut that is of no importance!\rA suspicion-arousing character, yes,\nbut your bragging is not necessary!\r
Inside the hotel, I will search.\nYou, I ask to search outside.\rThe suspect, he may have already\nslipped away ahead unnoticed.
