I like how Pokémon can use attacks.\nThat makes things fun and different.\rSometimes, when they get stronger,\nPokémon learn new moves.\rThat keeps things fresh and fun when\nusing moves.
Did you buy some Heal Balls at the\nPoké Mart?\rA Heal Ball completely heals the\nPokémon it captures on the spot.\rThat means you can catch a Pokémon\nand have it battle-ready right away.\rOf course, if your team has six\nPokémon in it, it won't do any good.
